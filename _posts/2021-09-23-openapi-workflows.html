<p>In response to folks asking us about the most common workflows for authoring an OpenAPI, we published an official answer to how we are seeing folks editing their OpenAPI, providing a link to a handful of everyday actions readers can consider. Like other answers published via this project, this answer will evolve as we define other ways people author their OpenAPIs. There is no single way to craft an OpenAPI, and understanding the different workflows helps make sure you are equipped for various scenarios. Allowing for teams to design, craft, produce, generate, or introduce OpenAPI into the overall API lifecycle. Acknowledging it needs to be there, but there are many ways to be injected into delivering APIs on the ground floor.</p>
