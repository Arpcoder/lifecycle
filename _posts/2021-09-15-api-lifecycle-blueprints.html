API lifecycle blueprints are meant to provide a simple, machine readable, and consistent way of defining the API lifecycle using common elements that are defined through useful actions. This project is focused on producing base and standardized blueprints for anyone to learn from and apply in their API operations, but also provide a structured approach to defining custom blueprints for any API operations. Blueprints are managed as a first-class resource using Jekyll running in the Github repository for this project, with each individual blueprint defined as YAML. Blueprints have meta-data for each area of the API lifecycle it covers, but then also has related elements and actions that can be reused and applied in a modular way across many different blueprints.
