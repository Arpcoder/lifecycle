<p>API lifecycle blueprints are meant to provide a simple, machine-readable, and consistent way of defining the API lifecycle using common elements defined through practical actions. This project focuses on producing base and standardized blueprints for anyone to learn from and apply in their API operations and provides a structured approach to defining custom blueprints for any API operations. Blueprints are managed as a first-class resource using Jekyll running in the Github repository for this project, with each blueprint defined as YAML. Blueprints have meta-data for each area of the API lifecycle it covers. They also have related elements and actions that can be reused and applied modularly across many different blueprints.</p>
