title: 'Automated Testing CI/CD Workflow'
---
The automated testing blueprint focused heavily on using monitors for the automation and only lightly on using a CI/CD pipeline. I added more details about how contract testing is made part of the CI/CD pipeline. Taking the testing, we generate from OpenAPI. We have created contract tests for them, making sure they are run as part of the pipeline and have relevant development and production environments. While also considering what we should be doing with the automated testing results, storing somewhere, or doing nothing and letting the pipeline fail to speak for itself. This made the Automated Testing blueprint a little more verbose, but we can keep refining and making something folks can use to inform their automated testing practices with some work.
