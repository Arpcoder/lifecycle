<p>We get asked regularly regarding why teams should be using API specifications like OpenAPI and AsyncAPI. If you arenâ€™t familiar with these API specifications or have much experience putting them to work, it is unlikely that you see the massive upside to putting them to work. To help standardize how we answer this question, we added a new answer to this age-old question, something we will keep refining over time. There are apparent benefits across the API lifecycle when using API specifications, most notably documentation and code generation. Still, they also have much more significant and profound human effects in helping us have more focused conversations around what an API is and does and why it matters to operations.</p>
