title: 'Taking Action Across the API Lifecycle'
---

This project works to provide a variety of blueprints defining different views of the API lifecycle, employing modular elements that describe the different areas of the API lifecycle. Within each element there are many different individual actions that can be taken to realize this portion of how we operate our APIs, providing an overview, videos, links, tooling, and other resources to help take some meaningful action across the enterprise API lifecycle. Actions are managed as a first-class resource using Jekyll running in the Github repository for this project, with each individual action defined as YAML. Actions are perpetually being updated to help map each one to a native platform feature or open source solution that will help make the action possible.
