<p>This project provides a variety of blueprints defining different views of the API lifecycle, employing modular elements that describe the other areas of the API lifecycle. Within each component, many different individual actions can be taken to realize this portion of how we operate our APIs, providing an overview, videos, links, tooling, and other resources to help take some meaningful action across the enterprise API lifecycle. Actions are managed as a first-class resource using Jekyll running in the Github repository for this project, with each action defined as YAML. Actions are being updated to help map each one to a native platform feature or open-source solution that will help make the action possible. </p>
