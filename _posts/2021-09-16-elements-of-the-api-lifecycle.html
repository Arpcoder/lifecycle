title: 'Elements of the API Lifecycle'
---

The lifecycle is made up of a number of common elements that help us move APIs from idea to deprecation. This project is about defining all of the common, and even some of the not so common elements of the API lifecycle and use them to define a variety of API blueprints. Elements are managed as a first-class resource using Jekyll running in the Github repository for this project, with each individual element defined as YAML. Elements have meta-data for what it does, but then also has related screenshots, tooling, and links that can be reused and applied in a modular way across many different blueprints.
