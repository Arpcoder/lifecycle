<p>We are getting requests from customers for deeper integration with Azure DevOps. We donâ€™t currently support a first-class integration with Azure DevOps, but using existing Postman collections and existing narratives to integrate with it provides a huge opportunity to integrate and automate with Azure DevOps via the Postman platform. There are also multiple issues submitted already with Postman app support requesting more integration with Azure DevOps, so I recommend heading over there and finding the one that matches what you need and piling on. While a first-class integration with Azure DevOps will make it easier, there are still significant opportunities to seamlessly integrate APIs developed on the Postman platform with Azure DevOps across our operations.</p>
