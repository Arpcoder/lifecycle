<p>To help illuminate the next steps for API lifecycle conversation, we are beginning to assemble a list of questions that help get at where folks are in their API journey and more about what some next steps might be when moving things forward. We added eight separate questions that help figure out where the best place to start is for the API lifecycle and governance.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://apis.how/questions/what-does-successfully-scaling-of-governance-look-like/">What does successfully scaling of governance can be?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apis.how/questions/when-and-what-would-you-celebrate-with-your-leadership/">When (and what) would you celebrate with your leadership?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apis.how/questions/would-you-like-help-defining-a-blueprint-of-your-api-lifecycle/">Would you like help to define a blueprint of your API lifecycle?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apis.how/questions/would-you-like-help-defining-an-api-design-guide/">Would you like help to define an API design guide?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apis.how/questions/would-you-like-to-run-governance-in-a-cicd-pipeline/">Would you like to run governance in a CI/CD pipeline?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apis.how/questions/would-you-like-to-run-governance-manually-in-workspaces/">Would you like to run governance manually in workspaces?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apis.how/questions/would-you-like-to-schedule-governance-using-a-monitor/">Would you like to schedule governance using a monitor?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://apis.how/questions/would-you-prefer-to-have-turnkey-api-governance/">Would you prefer to have turn-key API governance?</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We have a bunch more questions to add to the project; then, we’ll be continuing to associate these questions with elements, roles, and levels of maturity when it comes to how far along organizations are in their API journey. Then we’ll enable the ability to build questionnaires around some of these common API lifecycle questions.</p>
