<p>We are getting requests from customers for deeper integration with PingFederate. We don’t currently support a first-class integration with PingFederate, but using the official Ping public workspace and existing Postman collections for the administration of PingFederate provide a huge opportunity to integrate and automate with PingFederate via the Postman platform. There is also no issue currently submitted requesting PingFederate, so we encourage those who have asked to submit an issue. We’ll work to drive more attention to the issue of inclusion in our integration road map.</p>
