    description: Before starting a new API product, it is important to discover if the solution to the problem you're trying to solve already exists. Building on already existing functionality brings products and services to market faster. Postman has a number of features that makes this discovery step easier.

    description: Designing an interface is one of the most critical steps in the API's lifecycle. It involves making decisions on how the interface will look and feel when used. American software engineer Grady Booch calls these decisions "significant", where significance is measured by the cost of change. Once your API has its first user, the cost of changing that interface increases significantly. Applying the appropriate rigor at this stage of the lifecycle will decrease the likelihood that change is necessary later.

    description: Markets, strategies, team experience, and professional expectations change. So too do APIs. Changing an interface is no trivial task, however, given the number of people that may depend on it. Learning to prioritize and schedule changes to minimize the negative impacts is a skill. Thankfully, Postman includes features to navigate through this important step.

<p>Every organization creating APIs has an API lifecycle, whether they know it or not. The difference separating high-performing API companies from those with inconsistent results is a thoughtful and practiced approach. Below are key aspects of the API lifecycle, common characterists worth focusing on, and how Postmanâ€™s API platform supports each. </p>
