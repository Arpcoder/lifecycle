description: 
  - AsyncAPI is a machine readable specification for describing the surface area of your asynchronous APIs. OpenAPI is meant for describing synchronous APIs like REST using HTTP, and AsymcAPI is for describing websockets, MQTT, Kafka, NATS, and other syncrhonous, event-driven, and message APIs.

AsyncAPI was designed as a sister specification to OpenAPI, allowing for describing the full toolbox of APIs being put to work within the enterprise. Like OpenAPI AsyncAPI will describer the information about our API, and uses JSON Schema to describe the schema payload, but then also describe the channels, messages, and other details unique to asynchronous APIs. Providing a machine readable contract that can also be used to generate documentation, mock servers, and power testing. Powering the API lifecycle for asynchronous APIs in similar ways we have done for synchronous APIs in the last decade.
