Postman doesnâ€™t reinvent the wheel when it comes to application performance management and embraces the use of existing APM solutions by making them a first-class integration within the platform, allowing you to integrate with Datadog, New Relic, and other APM solutions. Platform APM integrations will enable you to pipe the results of any collection run via a monitor into existing APM infrastructure. This approach to integration allows results of collection runs for contract, integration, performance, and other types of tests to be piped into APM solutions, providing visibility over the execution of any collection.
