name: Server Code Generation
description: 
  - Generation of code in a variety of programming languages so that it can be used on the server for the deployment and deliver of APIs, providing code stubs that help reduce the repetitive work for developers.

The deployment of API is still largely done manually with the assistance of a CI/CD pipeline, but increasingly developers are generating server-side code in the programming language of their choice. The code that gets generated is rarely complete in that it fully works at time of generation, with most just tackling much of the redundant work in assembling the scaffolding, inputs, outputs, or the "skeleton" of the back-end code needed to power an API. Even with this limitation the generation of server side code saves a lot of time and resources when it comes to developing new, or iterating upon existing APIs. The Postman API platform allows for server-side code generation in a variety of languages, and there are also a number of open source libraries available to the generation of code for different platforms, and in each of the popular programing languages using OpenAPI, Swagger, and Postman Collections.
