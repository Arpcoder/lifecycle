  - Governance can be applied and automated at design time, providing real time or manually triggered application of governance rules, contracts, and scripts, providing a tighter feedback loop with API designers in regards to the guidance around what is expected of the design of each API.

It is best to provide governance feedback as early on in the lifecycle as possible, and automating governance at design time as part of the editor or IDE as a real-time intellisense feedback loop, or manually triggered to evaluate an OpenAPI or AsyncAPI being designed is a common approach to realizing governance at design time. Providing design time governance feedback and automation helps not just enforce rules, contracts, and script-based approaches to governance, it helps educate and make designers more aware of governance guidelines and why they exist. Making for a pretty significant opportunity to apply governance before any API ever reaches the development phase.
