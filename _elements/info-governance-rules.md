Info governance rules provide a base of YAML or JSON rules that can be applied to the info object within OpenAPI or AsyncAPI contracts, checking for specific patterns for the title, description, and other elements of an API. Rules can be defined centrally by governance leadership, or locally within teams, and then applied either at design, develop, or build time in a manual or automated way depending on the objectives of team, department, organization, or industry-wide governance.
