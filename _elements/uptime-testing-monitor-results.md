name: Uptime Testing Monitor Results
description: 
  - The results of any uptime testing run can be rendered as test results, presented using visualizer, and posted to existing APM or other destination that can be used as part of wider observability systems, allowing uptime tests across all APIs to be centralized for understanding API performance at scale.

When each collection is executed by a monitor it has a set of results that can be published to any location and saved for reporting upon and included in other dashboards. Having a strategy and standardized approach to handling the results of uptime test runs helps inform individual developers and testers how they can handle test rules, and potentially allowing compliance with overall organizational API governance. Formalizing how test results inform API operations in real time, but also potentially providing historical data on the uptime testing across teams and APIs.
