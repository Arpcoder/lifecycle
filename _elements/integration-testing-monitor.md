  - Monitors can be setup for all API integration testing, scheduling the run of integrations tests when needed, making sure that each individual API is regularly certified as working as expected, ensuring that APIs do not become a liability due to changes, but also keeping all APIs compliant with the latest level of integration testing that is occurring across an entire organization.

Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of integration test, taking any collection of API requests, complete with test scripts, combine with an environment, and run in a variety of cloud regions on a recurring schedule. Providing the ability to independently define the integration testing for each API, but then monitor the integration testing of each API over time to make sure nothing has changed. Providing the essential ingredient of automating integration testing and consistently applying across all APIs, helping ensure API contracts are always met when it comes to API operations.
