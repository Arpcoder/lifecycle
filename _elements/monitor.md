description: 
  - Monitoring any process across API operations defined as a collection, then bundled with any environment, setting a schedule for the execution of the collection, and viewing or publishing of the results to any other location, providing a very wide definition of what monitoring can mean across API operations.

Postman monitors allow you to schedule the run of any collection, automating the run of API testing, governance, workflows, and anything else that is API-driven and can be defined as a collection. Monitors allow for the automation and orchestration of an almost infinite number of API capabilities, allowing for automating working with APIs, but also the API lifecycle. Monitors are how the API lifecycle becomes the moving API factory floor of an organization across different teams. API monitors run collections combined with different environments then allow the results to be published and piped into existing APM and other solutions, helping make API operations more observable.
