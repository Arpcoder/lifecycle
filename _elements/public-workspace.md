  - Some APIs will benefit from establishing a public workspace where 3rd party consumers can learn about an API, view the moving parts of it's operation, and engage with the team behind, making the API lifecycle much more transparent.

Public API workspaces provides teams with the ability to change the visibility on their personal, private, and team workspace making them available to the general public, making APIs, collections, mock servers, and other elements of API operations accessible to any 3rd part consumer. Public workspaces are an evolution of the classic concept of a developer portal, but widening the scope to include more of the operations around each API instead of just the API itself. Opening up access around aPIs to 3rd party consumers, but also allowing them to engage by watching, commenting, and forking APIs as part of integrating and putting APIs to work in applications and other systems.
