Versioning governance rules provide a base of YAML or JSON rules that can be applied to OpenAPI or AsyncAPI contracts, checking for common versioning patterns in the path, parameters, headers, and other elements of an API. Rules can be defined centrally by governance leadership, or locally within teams, and then applied either at design, develop, or build time in a manual or automated way depending on the objectives of team, department, organization, or industry-wide governance.
