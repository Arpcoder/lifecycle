Desktop, web, and mobile applications are likely what we mean when using the word "application" as part of our work. But in the last decade, the word is also being used to describe devices, network, and other ways we can apply digital resources today. Applications are the tangible result of API consumption that end-users see and put to work in their personal and professional lives. It is common for APIs to be developed to serve a single application. Still, increasingly organizations are looking to deliver APIs independent of specific applications and can be used across several different known and unknown applications.
