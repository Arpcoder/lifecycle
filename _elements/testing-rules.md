  - Having machine readable or codified rules that ensure there is required testing in place for all APIs helps make sure that a baseline set of tests exist across all APIs, ensuring that contracts are upheld, integrations are maintained, performance is at acceptable levels, and there are not security vulnerabilities present in any API in production.

Testing rules are about established well define guidance for what testing should exist as part of the lifecycle for each API, as well as how these rules can applied and evaluated as part of a wider API governance strategy. Consistent testing across all APIs is essential to realizing quality at scale across an organization, and testing rules provide the foundation for how you guide developers in making sensible testing decisions as they develop and sustain their APIs, as well as automate the reporting on which APIs are in compliance with organization wide testing, and which are note.
