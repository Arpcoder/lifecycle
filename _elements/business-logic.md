Business logic can be applied to APIs at request, publish, subscribe, integration, and automation time. Adding rules regarding the transformation of API payloads to better suit specific applications and business needs, helping evolve data, content, and algorithm at run time. Business logic can be a critical part of allowing API providers and consumers to evolve legacy infrastructure, but it also comes at a cost, introducing latency and complexity into the mix, and business logic should be applied thoughtfully, and not used to replace to evolution and iteration of API resources to meet the business needs of consumers.
