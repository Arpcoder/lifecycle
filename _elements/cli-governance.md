Developers will want to be able to apply governance at the command line level, taking common rules and scripts and apply them to OpenAPI and other artifacts locally while developing APIs, or just exploring how governance works. Running of rules, collections, and other artifacts of API governance locally provides a safe space for developers to learn in and matches with their existing software development practices, allowing them to apply centralized or federated governance locally on the desktop, or anywhere the CLI is being run.
