  - Identifying the roles of each team member working on an API helps establish clear directives for who can make changes to an API, something that can drive and configure other elements applying to an API across the lifecycle.

As a team admin, you have the power to define Postman access at the team level. You can utilize Postman's role-based access control system to limit visibility of team resources, define your development workflow, and provide access to administrative personnel. Team members with the billing role can modify who else has billing roles at the team level. Workspace admins can modify the admin and collaborator roles for the workspace. Editors of particular elements (APIs, collections, environments, monitors, and mock servers) can modify the editor and viewer role on the element. With these roles, you and your teammates can manage access for each individual, or, if you are on a Postman Enterprise plan, for groups.
