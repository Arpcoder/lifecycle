Tracking the activity that occurs across the design, development, and operation of APIs allows the ability to see what changes are made by teams to APIs and the supporting artifacts. Ensuring that there is observability present across the management of each API without teams having to do any additional work, tracking all changes, and then make this information visible to everyone involved. Providing an ongoing snapshot of the activity involved with moving each API forward, making sure nothing gets lost along the way. You can find an activity for each workspace using the overview tab and across workspaces via the home page of your Postman application.
