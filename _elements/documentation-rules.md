As part of wider governance it makes sense that all APIs should be documented, but it helps to have well defined guidance and rules that helps make sure it isn't forgotten along the way. Documentation rules can help remind developers that they need documentation, as well as provide clear direction for what tools they should be use, and what process is involved with delivering up to date and accurate documentation. Depending on the process, these documentation rules can be automated, providing checks along the way that make sure documentation has been published, and even provide tests to ensure that it is up to date and matches the technical details of an API, and has all the necessary details.
