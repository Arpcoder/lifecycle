With the run of each contract test monitor the results can be viewed using visualizer at run time, or the results can be saved, and reported upon later. Contract testing monitor results can be viewed internally within Postman and each contract testing collection using the visualizer tab and supporting test script, keeping reporting localized to each API and it's tests. Contract testing monitor results can also be piped into other APM solutions using integrations, allowing for reporting to occur within dashboards within existing APM solutions used by teams.
