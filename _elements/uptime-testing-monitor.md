Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of uptime test, taking any collection of API requests, complete with test scripts, combine with an environment, and run in a variety of cloud regions on a recurring schedule. Providing the ability to independently define the uptime testing for each API, but then monitor the uptime testing of each API over time to make sure nothing has changed. Providing the essential ingredient of automating uptime testing and consistently applying across all APIs, helping ensure API contracts are always met when it comes to API operations.
