Design review timelines should by standardized and made known to API designers and developers, setting expectations for what it will take to get feedback, and move forward int he delivery of their API. The timeline will vary depending on the scope of the API being developed, but this variability should be communicated and calculated, ensuring that the timeline expectations match each individual API, but adhere to an agreed upon timeline.
