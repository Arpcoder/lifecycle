Injecting API design reviews into the early part of the API lifecycle. Requiring designers and developers to submit an OpenAPI, examples, and other supporting assets to a design reviewer for a formal review. Providing designers and developers with what they need to get an API as complete as possible before submission, and possess everything needed for reviewers to effectively examine an API for compliance. Then reviewing an API for a well defined period of time, providing verbal and written feedback about the state of the design for an API, then move the review process towards an outcome where it goes back to development, or moves to production.
