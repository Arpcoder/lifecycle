When it comes to synchronous or request and response APIs events manifest themselves as part of the operation of webhooks, where API calls are made outward when some new event happens. When it comes to asynchronous APIs events take a much more front row seat as part of event-driven approaches to API design where API connections are sustained and messages are published to APIs and events can be subscribed to, bringing a more real-time view of the API landscape. Understanding what events are occurring around API operations is a valuable exercise no matter what type of architectural patterns are applied, and can make for a view of operations that reflects actual business events that matter to operations.
