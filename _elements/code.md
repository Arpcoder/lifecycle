Coded instructions in a variety of languages is necessary for both producing and consuming APIs. There are many views of what the role code has when it comes to delivering APIs and putting them to work, with many modern approaches evolving towards a low-code or even no-code approach to integrating, automating, and orchestrating with APIs. Code is not going away as a fixture across the API landscape, but how it is applied, and the overall role of the developer is rapidly evolving towards a more DevOps approach to not just putting individual instances of APIs to work, but also the underlying architecture that is used to operate APIs.
