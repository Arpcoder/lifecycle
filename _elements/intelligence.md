There is a wealth of data generated across API operations through the infrastructure and tooling you use to develop and manage your APIs that can be used to develop more intelligence about what is happening across operations. Developing an awareness across API operations was the purpose behind API management, and stepping up to generate intelligence in real-time across internal, partner, and public APIs is what modern API infrastructure is all about. There are numerous ways in which intelligence can be derived and and acted upon as part of operations, but it will take a strategy, and active investment before intelligence can lay a real-time role in manually or automatically guiding the API lifecycle.
