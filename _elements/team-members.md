Once a team or public workspace has been established for an API, or group of APIs, it is time to define and invite all relevant team members to the workspace. Sitting down to make sure your team is well defined and invited to your workspace and repositories allows you to think through who is involved, what roles they have in moving an API forward, and is something you can revisit on a regular basis. It is also something that allows others to easily see who is involved with an API, and who they can reach out to with questions or feedback through the life of an API.
