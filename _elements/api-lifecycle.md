name: API Lifecycle
description: It is impossible to govern an API lifecycle that is not defined. It takes a clear and articulate definition of how the API lifecycle is put into motion across teams to be able to reach a point where you can measure, guide, enforce, and evolve how APIs move across a well defined API lifecycle in any consistent way.

This project is all about defining the base of the API lifecycle, but also the different entry points and priorities that exist across the API lifecycle so that we can better understand, measure, and ultimately govern how APIs move through the API lifecycle. Without governance applying to all areas of the API lifecycle you are unable to effectively govern APIs and achieve the velocity and symmetry needed to move an entire organization forward. An API lifecycle should augment and overlap with the existing software development lifecycle in place within an organization, but work support the specific needs of APIs, acknowledging they are central to desktop, web, mobile, and device applications, but also to the overall IT operations and infrastructure behind everything.
