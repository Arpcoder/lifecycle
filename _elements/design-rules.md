name: Design Rules
description: 
  - Machine readable rules that can be applied at design, develop, or build time to govern the design of each API, evaluating artifacts to ensure that specific design patterns are followed when crafting each API, helping make sure that APIs follow common API patterns within an industry, or as defined by the enterprise organization.

Design rules provide modular, codified artifacts that can be used to lint API artifacts like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema. Defining rules that represent practices that we want to see repeated across the design of our APIs, manually applied by developers at design and develop time, but also allowing them rules to be automated and run on a schedule or at build time via pipelines. Helping establish formal definitions for what API design practices should look like, educating designers and developers along the way, and also being able to actively enforce these rules going into production.
