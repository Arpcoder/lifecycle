Every API should have an overview, providing a summary of why it exists, what it does, how to use, and a snapshot of what has happened around the API as part of it's operations. An overview for each API allows anyone that is interested to get up to speed on an API with just a few moments of scanning what is available on the overview page or dashboard. Overviews provide a snapshot of what is happening with an API, but also provide insight into the lifecycle of an API, showing multiple versions, what stage an API is in of it's evolution, and other elements related to the forward motion of an API. Overviews are essential to the operation of healthy APIs, helping ensure everyone is in alignment around each individual API, but also across APIs at scale.
