  - Establishing a formal process for how APIs are taken down, stored, and kept for potential usage in the future, avoiding the deletion of each API soon as it is deprecated.

Once an API has been retired and has reached a well-established deprecation date, it should be archived instead of deleted. Backing up any artifacts, policies, code, and data behind the API for future reference and possibly putting back into production if needed. This approach allows APIs to be audited, but from the consumer's external view of API consumers, the API had been removed from servers, gateway, or any other API infrastructure. Ensuring that deprecated APIs do not exist in production helps limit vulnerabilities while allowing for deprecated APIs to be retrieved if needed at any time in the future.
