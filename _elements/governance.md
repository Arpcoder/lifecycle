Governance begins with a well-defined API lifecycle for each API, providing clear steps for moving each API forward from design to production. Most API governance efforts begin with the establishment API design guidance and rules that help produce more consistent APIs across teams, but then governance can easily evolve to other areas of the API lifecycle like documentation, testing, and security. API governance has a symbiotic relationship with every stop along the API lifecycle, but definitely begins and evolves as part of the design of the surface area of each API, and the establishment of machine readable artifacts like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema that help formalize how we talk about API governance, but also how we measure and enforce that governance is being realized across teams.
