Partner workspaces provide an externally facing, yet private look at an API and the operations around it, allowing a trusted audience to gain access to APIs, documentation, testing, environments, mock servers, monitors, and other elements of the API lifecycle in a single location. Partner workspaces allow you to bring partners and other external stakeholders into the API lifecycle without having to expand your internal teams, striking a balance between team workspaces and entirely public workspaces. Expanding our API operations from just within the enterprise firewall and opening them up for wider access with a trusted audience, balancing privacy, security, and access to API resources and capabilities.
