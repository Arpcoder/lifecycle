Once an API has been published to the API gateway there will be a steady stream of usage reports available for using to understand how an API is being used by consumers. Gateway usage can be accessed via the gateway API, making pulling of API usage results via collection and visualization using the collection visualizer a great way to report upon usage. Allowing usage reports to be defined as collections, and organized as part of the other API artifacts and reporting within the workspace being used to manage an API.
