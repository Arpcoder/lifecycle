  - Documentation published as human consumable HTML pages help potential API consumers learn about what an API does by describing the paths, channels, parameters, headers, schema, messages, and other building blocks of APIs, showing examples of what is possible or by providing an API client to make calls to each API as part of the documentation.

API documentation is the number one pain point for API consumers, and is the toughest area to keep accurate and up to date for API producers. API documentation has evolved over the last decade and become a natural part of API developer portals, something that is baked into API management solutions, as well as seeing waves of open source solutions emerge. API documentation is rarely hand-crafted, and most times generated using OpenAPI definitions, and natively part of defining any API using a Postman collection. API documentation should be publishable, sharable, and something that is always keeping up to date with the latest changes, allowing any API stakeholder to read and easily understand what they need to do to put an API to work in their application or integration.
