Auditing API infrastructure is essential to understanding how we got where at a high level within operations. Auditing allows the ability to tune into the most meaningful events occurring across the infrastructureâ€”understanding the billing associated with different solutions, domain management, authentication configuration, role-based access control, and many of the high-level operational activities occurring.
