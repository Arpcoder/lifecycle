Auditing of API infrastructure is essential to being able to understand how we go where we are from a high level within operations. Auditing provides the ability to tune into the most meaningful events that are occurring across infrastructure. Understanding the billing associated with different solutions, domain management, authentication configuration, role based access control, and as many of the high level operational activities that are occurring. Rising above individual or groups of APIs and understanding the moving parts of operations, keeping stakeholders aware of what has happened in real time, as well as when anyone needs to go back and understand how we got here as part of a post mortem.
