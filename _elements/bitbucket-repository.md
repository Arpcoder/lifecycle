Bitbucket repositories can be used in conjunction with Postman throughout the API lifecycle, providing a way to keep artifacts synced, and automate the API lifecycle as part of the CI/CD process defined around a Bitbucket repository. Bitbucket repositories provides not just code source control, but also API source of truth as part of the deployment of APIs, that can be managed and kept in alignment with the rest of the API lifecycle using the Postman platform and seamless integrations with Bitbucket.
