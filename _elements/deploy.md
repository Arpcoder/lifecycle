  - Using an API gateway to deploy and manage APIs provides a single or federated approach to providing access to backend services using well defined APIs, standardizing how APIs are published to development, staging, production, or other environments, while also consistently apply authentication, logging, and the other elements needed to properly manage APIs at scale.

The deployment or publishing of APIs can come in many forms, but modern approaches to API deployment almost always involve source control, CI/CD, as well as API gateways, producing repeatable, tested, and automated approaches to putting APIs into all stages of the lifecycle. API deployment will reflect your existing software development lifecycle and the tools and processes your existing development teams use to deliver applications, but is something that has been evolving through evolution in the cloud, containers, serverless, and gateways, while continuing to be stabilized using source control and repeatable CI/CD workflows.
