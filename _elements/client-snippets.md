  - Simple easy to apply snippets of code in a variety of programming languages for each individual API request, providing ready to go resources for developers to use when learning about how an API works, while also potentially jump-starting integration and putting to use in applications.

Contrasting to full software development kits, client-side API code snippets provide simple single use snippets in a variety of programming languages, providing only the essentials a developer will need to integrate with an API. Developers won't always need access to the full surface area of an API present in a complete SDK, and will benefit from accessing a single API call via a client-side code snippet in their language of choice. Like SDKs, client-side code snippets can be auto-generated from OpenAPI and Postman collections, and are playing an increasing role in serverless approaches to API integration and automation. Client-side code snippets help reduce the cognitive load for developers who are onboarding, and help ensure an API speaks their native language, allowing them to go from learning to making an API call in as short of period as possible.
