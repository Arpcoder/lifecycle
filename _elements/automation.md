  - Automated production or consumption of API resources, allowing for repeatable API-driven processes to be triggered or scheduled, allowing teams to define and set into motions certain aspects of operations while focusing on the more manual, creative, and human aspects of doing APIs.

Automation centers around the collection, which can be automated using runners, monitors, or as part of CI/CD pipelines using the open-source Newman. Postman collections define any single or series of API calls, complete with authentication, providing a very versatile and executable unit of API value. A well-organized collection can use many API calls arranged in a specific order and organized by folder, which when ran provides a well-defined and repeatable series of API-driven actions. The automation of collection comes into the picture once you begin scheduling these collections to run on a schedule or become baked into each commit to the repo as part of its pipeline. This approach leverages CI/CD to open up the doorway to a potentially unlimited number of possibilities for API automation as part of the delivery of APIs or as part of the consumption and integration of digital resources and capabilities across many different APIs. Collections plus monitors are your doorways to the world of API automation today.<
