  - Automating producing or consumption of API resources and capabilities, allowing for repeatable API-driven process to be triggered, scheduled, or respond to events, allowing for teams to properly define and set into motions certain aspects of operations while they focus on the more manual, creative, and human aspects of doing APIs.

Automation centers around the collection, which can be automated using runners, monitors, or as part of CI/CD pipelines using the open source Newman. Collections can be used to define any single or series of API calls, complete with authentication, providing a very versatile and executable unit of API value. A well organized collection can define many API calls arranged in a specific order and organized by folder, which when ran provides a well defined and repeatable series of API-driven actions. The automation of collection comes into the picture once you begin scheduling these collections to run on a schedule or become baked into each commit to a repo as part of it's pipeline. Opening up the doorway to a potentially unlimited number of possibilities for API automation as part of the delivery of APIs, or as part of the consumption and integration of digital resources and capabilities across many different APIs. Collections plus monitors are your doorway to the world of API automation today.
