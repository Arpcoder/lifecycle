Each individual API requests allows anyone to define the domain, path, method, parameterss, headers, cookies, body, and other technical details of an HTTP API request. Making syncrhonous APIs accessible via an API client, but also allowing the request to be organized as part of a larger collection of requests, and then saved, shared, and executed. Providing a human and machine readable representation of each API request that opens up the request to be run by anyone who has access to the API without having to right code. Widening who can put APIs to work, give them the ability to capture a single request as a tangible and reusable unit of value as defined by an API, or a group of APIs.
