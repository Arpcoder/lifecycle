description: 
  - A Postman collection for applying governance provides a flexible way to apply rules, schema, or script based governance, allowing governance to be defined as modular collections which can be manually run by developers, scheduled using a monitor, or easily dropped into a CI/CD pipeline.

Postman collections can be designed to run governance against an OpenAPI, applying rules or scripts against an OpenAPI pulled via URL, API, or submitted as part of the body of the API request. Having governance defined as a collection provides the flexibility for designers and developers to run manually using Postman on the web or desktop, and engage with test results and reporting via visualizer. Allowing developers to learn about governance and apply to any OpenAPI manually, scheduled via a monitor, or easily dropped into a CI/CD pipeline. Providing a very flexible approach to applying governance across the entire API lifecycle.
