APIs are just about managing relationships between producer and consumers, as well as across the mix of stakeholders involved in the process to bring an API resource or capability to life and keep in active and bringing value to an organization. The relationships within a team, with other teams where there are dependencies will all dictate the forward motion and velocity an API will possess, which will further be defined by, but also dictate the relationship with the consumers. A healthy and robust API lifecycle is defined by the relationships that exist, something that is easier to cultivate when you are deliberate in defining and cultivating the right relationships, over being in denial and avoiding the relationships that exist.
