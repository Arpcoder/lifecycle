Having goals for each API helps articulate the value an API should be delivering in plain language. Goals can be as simple as a paragraph narrative or a bulleted list. Goals should help a team better understand what the business value for an API will be, and help keep the technical details of an API more precise when it comes to design and development, as well as iteration with each version. Keeping goals an active part of each version of an API, and making sure they are published as part of documentation, and within reach of the team within a workspace helps make sure APIs are as coherent as possible in their evolution.
