Postman is a web and desktop API client designed to help test, troubleshoot, and debug APIs. API clients go beyond interactive documentation, allowing you to configure all aspects of each request, publish, or subscribe to an API, controlling as many of the details including authentication, headers, and other often invisible aspects of working with APIs. API clients work much like your API browsers in letting you navigate the API landscape, but are not intended to abstract away how the web works, but work to reveal all of the ways you can configure HTTP, Websockets, and the other technical details of how APIs operate. An API client is a critical part of the API lifecycle for both API producers and consumers, providing an interface for working with APIs, but also allowing to save, share, and collaborate with others when it comes to putting APIs to work.
