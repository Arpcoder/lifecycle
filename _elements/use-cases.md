Understanding the real world business use cases for an API is important to the design, delivery, and operation of each individual API, but also many different APIs working in concert to move an organization forward. Use cases should be defined for each API as simple narrative or bulleted examples, written in plain language, and reflecting actual business value generated for consumers. API use cases should be made part of the API contract, documentation, and other elements of the API lifecycle, helping ground testing, discovery, and other needs in actual business outcomes. Ensuring that anyone can quickly find the use cases for each API and understand why it exists and how it provides value for consumers.
