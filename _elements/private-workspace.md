Private workspaces allow individuals to establish a workspace that is ony accessible on an invite only basis, allowing team members to keep APIs, collections, and other elements accessible to a limited audience until wider visibility is required. Private workspaces keep the design, development, operation, and consumption of APIs tightly controlled to meet the differing needs of each API resource and capability. Providing a mix of visibility options for API producers and consumers to choose from when it comes to meeting their individual project needs.
