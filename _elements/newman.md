Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line. It is built with extensibility in mind so that you can easily integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems. Newman maintains feature parity with Postman and allows you to run collections the way they are executed inside the collection runner in Postman. The open source Newman combined with the open source collection and environment provides a portable, executable unit of value that can be applied anywhere across API operations at the command line or pipeline layers. Providing for a robust way to apply API testing manually or in an automated way as part of the regular software development lifecycle, baking testing and governance into operations.
