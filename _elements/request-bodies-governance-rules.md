Request body governance rules provide a base of YAML or JSON rules that can be applied to the request bodies object within OpenAPI contracts, checking for specific patterns like whether it should have a body, the media type, example, and other details of an API. Rules can be defined centrally by governance leadership, or locally within teams, and then applied either at design, develop, or build time in a manual or automated way depending on the objectives of team, department, organization, or industry-wide governance.
