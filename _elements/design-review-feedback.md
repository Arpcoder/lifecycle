The feedback loop during the API design review process should be well defined, and communicated early on, helping set expectations for whether it will come in real time, or at the end of the process. Feedback should be verbal and / or written, providing as much detail as possible about what is working and what is not working. Feedback during the API design review process should reflect the state of each API being reviewed, but also be in alignment overall API design governance strategy.
