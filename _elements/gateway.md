  - API gateways provide a centralized or federated approach to the deployment and management of APIs at scale across an organization, leveraging commercial or open source API gateways to deploy APIs into development, staging, production, or other environment, allowing for the standardization of common elements of API management, and configuring APIs using common policies.

Gateways are an essential aspect of the API lifecycle, providing a standardized way for publishing and providing access to APIs. Gateways are available as commercial or open source offerings, and are a default part of cloud infrastructure, having been commoditized around 2015, and become critical to the API lifecycle. Gateways use OpenAPI and other artifacts to define routes, and often use extensions to route requests to backend systems, applying consistent policies across APIs to define identity and access control, transformations, logging, and other common needs in managing APIs. The gateway is how APIs are published, but it is also how producers stay aware of how API consumers are putting APIs to work, establishing awareness of how API resources are being applied.
