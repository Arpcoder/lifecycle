Keeping everyone informed around what is happening with the design and development of an APIs can be a full time job, and requires a regular investment into strategies for making sure information is getting where it is needed, when it is needed, meeting the needs of a mix of roles involved in the API lifecycle. There are many proven ways for keeping teams producing APIs, as well as consumers putting APIs to work on the same page, but ultimately each team will have it's own unique needs and should be exploring different approaches until they find what works for their community.
