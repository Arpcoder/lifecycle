With the run of each security test monitor the results can be viewed using visualizer at run time, or the results can be saved, and reported upon later. Security testing monitor results can be viewed internally within Postman and each security testing collection using the visualizer tab and supporting test script, keeping reporting localized to each API and it's tests. Security testing monitor results can also be piped into other APM solutions using integrations, allowing for reporting to occur within dashboards within existing APM solutions used by teams.
