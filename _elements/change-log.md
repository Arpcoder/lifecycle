The change log for an API should inform stakeholders regarding what has happened with the design and development of an API, providing a single place that any team member or consumers can go to get up to speed on what has changed. Providing a self-service log of the change that has occurred, reducing the need to talk to designers and developers, helping increase velocity of team members, while also making sure there is a thorough record available for each API to keep all stakeholders informed regarding the change that is occurring across a platform.
