  - Utilizing common design patterns and standards for the design, development, and operation of APIs helps ensure APIs leverage a common vocabulary and increases the chances that consumers will understand how to put an API to work in their applications, increasing the effectiveness of an API, and helping increase the productivity and velocity of producers and consumers.

There are many common design patterns for API designers and developers to use as part of the API lifecycle. Some design patterns come from approaches like REST, while others are more standardized like JSON API, or Hypermedia media types. The more consistent design patterns that are used as part of the delivery of an API the more likely it is to be familiar and adopted by consumers. As API providers we just shouldn't be re-inventing the wheel with things like pagination, and utilizing as many web standards as we possibly can. Design patterns should be a regular part of the API lifecycle discussion from design to production, and teams should have access to a robust toolbox of design patterns and supporting educational resources as they iterate upon API infrastructure.
