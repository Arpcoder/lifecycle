  - Governance can be applied at the pipeline level, enforcing API governance at build time, ensuring that APIs are 100% compliant with rules, contract, and script-based API governance established centrally as part of broader governance efforts.

The enforcement of API governance at the pipeline layer is not ideal in all situations and organizations. Still, it is a very desirable objective for realizing consistency in delivering APIs across an organization. Rules, contracts, and script-based governance can be codified into specific collections and then easily executed as part of the pipeline, ensuring that the OpenAPI or AsyncAPI contract for any API build aligns with a wider governance strategy. Pipeline enforcement is the desire of governance leadership at the higher levels. Still, it will take a considerable amount of work to achieve without introducing friction across teams doing the hard work to keep API operations moving ahead at the desired velocity.
