  - It can be helpful to provide new users with documentation designed specifically for onboarding new consumers to an API, only introducing them to the most relevant paths of an API, reducing the cognitive load when it comes to getting started with an API and complimenting more complete reference documentation showing everything that is possible with an API.

Reference documentation for APIs should exist for any API, providing a complete reference of all API paths available, but when it comes to helping reduce the cognitive load for developers when they are onboarding, it can help having a subset or specialized set of documentation designed to onboard developers as quickly as possible. Onboarding API documentation provides the details of only the most common paths developers will need to get up and running with an API, or maybe a specific set of paths that a certain type of partner within an industry will need to get up and running. Onboarding API documentation helps make APIs more accessible and reduces friction for developers when it comes to going from discovery to integration, in as few steps as possible.
