Not all APIs will experience a design phase, with many moving forward as part of a code-first or more traditional software development lifecycle, making develop time governance another way to enforce and enable teams when it comes to helping deliver more consistent APIs. Develop time governance automation still requires there to be machine readable artifacts like OpenAPI or AsyncAPI present, generated using annotations or other approach, but then allows developers to apply rules, contract, or script-based governance to the API they are developing. Automating the guidance around government in a way that works seamlessly with developers existing software development practices, allowing them to do what they do best, but regularly check to make sure they are in alignment with team, department, organization, or industry API governance practices.
