API governance guidelines provide a single document that teams can use to understand what is the optimal way to design, develop, and operate an API. Providing human, but also linked to machine readable sets of rules that can be used to establish a baseline for what APIs are within an organization. API design is where most organizations will look to get started with API governance guidelines, but then most will often need to move quickly beyond design and begin standardizing documentation, testing, communication, versioning, and much more across API operations. The governance guidelines are meant to be the central record of what governance looks like across an organization.
