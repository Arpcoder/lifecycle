name: Single Sign On (SSO) description:

Single sign-on (or SSO) is an authentication approach that allows users to access several related yet independent software systems with a single set of credentials. When fully implemented, SSO allows a user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors. 
... The larger the organization, the more services to navigate, and the bigger hassle of managing separate logins and passwords. SSO solves this problem. SSO requires a relationship between an application, like Postman, and a company's identity provider. The SAML 2.0 standard is means by which an application can exchange authentication and authorization information. When configured correctly, users can use the credentials configured with their identity provider to access software systems.
