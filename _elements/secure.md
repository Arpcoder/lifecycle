  - Ensuring that an API is secure from threats and vulnerabilities, making for a pretty wide spectrum of different processes and technologies that ensure digital resources and capabilities made available via APIs are only accessible to an intended audience and bad actors are not able to find ways to get access via an API.

The securing of API infrastructure should be the number one concern for organizations. With the number of APIs powering desktop, web, mobile, and device applications, the surface area for vulnerabilities is only increasing, raising the stakes when it comes to how secure an organization. This element of the API lifecycle spans multiple other areas including management via authentication, and testing using security testing and monitoring practices. Security is about not just securing each individual API, but also being able to consistently apply it across hundreds or thousands of APIs. How secure an organization is is increasingly dependent on how teams are able to apply the latest security practices as part of their regular work without having to become security experts on top of their existing role. Because of this DevOps shift in how our organizations are operating, security is shifting left and becoming something that isn't an afterthought or a stage of the API lifecycle later on, and moving earlier on in the design and development of APIs.
