Scripting is available as each individual API request is about to run as well as right after it executes and the response is returned, providing essential testing, automation, and workflow automation capabilities baked into each individual request as defined by a Postman collection. Scripting utilizes JavaScript as used on the server by Node.js, as well as in the browser, but embeds the JavaScript into each individual request allowing for the manipulation of each API request as it runs, and then the ability to work with the results of each response for automation, storage, or even visualization using the Postman Visualizer. Scripting represents the greatest opportunity for automation across APIs and represents functionality that is not found on any other platform in a way that is as versatile as collections and environments empowered through the pre-request and post-request scripting capabilities. Providing a low-code environment for developers to automate on top of APIs, but then save, share, and publish as a no-code collection that anyone can execute without having to write code--widening who can put APIs to work within any organization.
