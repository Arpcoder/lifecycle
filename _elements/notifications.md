Notifications are designed to keep developers informed across the APIs that matter. Providing in-application, email, and other types of integration-enabled notifications via existing channels. Notifications help make API operations and the API lifecycle real time and event-driven, helping keep developers up to speed on what is happening without having to go find the information themselves. Notifications provide the heartbeat of what teams are up and what they are doing when it comes to producing and consuming APIs. Notifications represents the next generation of communication around API operations, replacing email, chat, and other existing forms of communicating, making notifications more precise and applicable to what developers are worried about.
