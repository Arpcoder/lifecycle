name: Build Time Governance Automation
description: 
  - Governance can be applied at the pipeline level enforcing API governance at build time, ensuring that APIs are 100% compliant with rules, contract, and script-based API governance established centrally as part of wider governance efforts, making sure all APIs in production are consistent and compliant with established governance.

The enforcement of API governance at the pipeline layer is not ideal in all situations and organizations, but is a very desirable objective when it comes to realizing consistency in the delivery of APIs across an organization. Rules, contract, and script-based governance can be codified into specific collections and then easily execute as part of the pipeline, ensuring that the OpenAPI or AsyncAPI contract for any API build is in alignment with a wider governance strategy. Pipeline enforcement is the desire of governance leadership at the higher levels, but is something that will take a considerable amount of work to achieve without introducing friction across teams doing the hard work to keep API operations moving ahead at a desired velocity.
