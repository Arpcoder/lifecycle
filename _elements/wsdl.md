The Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is an XML-based interface description language that is used for describing the functionality offered by a web service. The acronym is also used for any specific WSDL description of a web service, which provides a machine-readable description of how the service can be called, what parameters it expects, and what data structures it returns. Therefore, its purpose is roughly similar to that of a type signature in a programming language. A WSDL can be imported or created from scratch to kick-off an API lifecycle, using the web service definition to generate documentation, mock servers, or tests, allowing legacy SOAP web services to managed as part of a more modern API lifecycle, bringing it up to par with other more modern microservices and APIs when it comes to elements of their operation.
