Description governance rules provide a base of YAML or JSON rules that can be applied to the description object within OpenAPI or AsyncAPI contracts, checking for specific patterns for the length or contents of a description, and other elements of an API. Rules can be defined centrally by governance leadership, or locally within teams, and then applied either at design, develop, or build time in a manual or automated way depending on the objectives of team, department, organization, or industry-wide governance.
