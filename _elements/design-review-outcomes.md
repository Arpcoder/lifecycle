Like other parts of the API design process developers should know what to expect as part of the outcome of the API design review. Outcomes should provide designers and developers with what they need to go back to the design process confidently, or provide what they need to move forward with deploying the API into production. The outcomes of each API design review process should ensure APIs meet the expectations of an organization, as well as the consumers who will be putting to work, while helping equip designers and developers with what they need to be successful.
