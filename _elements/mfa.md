name: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
description: 
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (or MFA) is an authentication method to ensure a digital user is who they say they are. During an MFA process, a user is granted access to a software system only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to the authentication service. Evidence may be in the form of knowledge (a password), possession (a device), or inherence (biometric data). MFA significantly increases the security of logins, with each additional factor decreasing the ability for an unauthorized individual to pretend to be a legitimate user.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is used to ensure that digital users are who they say they are by requiring that they provide at least two pieces of evidence to prove their identity. Each piece of evidence must come from a different category:
* Something they know (like a password)
* Something they have (like a mobile phone or hardware authentication fob)
* Something they are (a fingerprint or retinal scan)
If a malicious party compromises one of the factors, the chances of another factor also being compromised are low, thus reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. MFA is a commonly enabled part of a single sign-on process.
