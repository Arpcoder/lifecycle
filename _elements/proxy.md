A proxy server acts as a security barrier between your internal network and the Internet, keeping others on the Internet from accessing information on your internal network. In basic web speak, a client makes a request to the server, and the server sends back a response. A proxy server is an application or system that acts as an intermediary between your computer and the internet, or more specifically, the client and server. The proxy makes requests on your behalf to websites, servers, and other internet services. The proxy can reside on your local machine, somewhere in your network, or at any point between your client and the destination server on the internet. The Postman proxy allows you to assert more control over the API traffic behind applications, and capture, save, replay, and automate around the requests you capture.
