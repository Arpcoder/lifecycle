# API Lifecycle & Governance
This is a project to distill down many views of a modern lifecycle into many re-usable elements and actions organized into blueprints that provide a series of steps within a specific dimension of the API lifecycle.

**Workspace:** https://apis.how/

We are still working on ways to add to and evolve the content available here, add a visual layer, and play around with different ways of presenting them, helping reduce information overload and make it easier to discover and put to work across the API lifecycle.

## Roles
Your view of the API lifecycle will depend on your role within the enterprise, so we have organized API lifecycle blueprints by role to help make them a little more accessible and relevant to your world.
