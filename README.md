# API Lifecycle & Governance Blueprints
This is our Git managed process for centralizing the ideation and creation of consistent content, providing a single reference for concepts across the API lifecycle and operations--feel free to use, fork, and submit any content.
## Blueprints
A blueprint is just a concept. It begins with an idea, grows with discussion and research, and then becomes an outline, which can be used as a buffet of concepts to work with when producing blog posts, videos, decks, and other reusable content.
### Postman
These are blueprints that are specific to Postman, and how we operate different aspects of Open Tech.

## Process
The process we are using to move blueprints forward is an ever evolving one, but to help encourage participation across the team, and even from the community, here are steps we are taking to create new blueprints, and iterate upon existing ones.
- **Ideas** - Use a miro board to get all the concepts on the table in a visual way.
- **Discussion** - Use Github issue to discuss each concept as we iterate upon.
- **Outline** - Use individual markdown files as the source of outline for each version.
- **Deck** - Create a deck to convey the concept for use in demos and presentations.
- **Slide** - Create a single slide to convey the concept for use in slide decks.
- **Blog** - Publish a blog post to support the concept and help tell the sotry.
- **Video** - Publish a video using Space Camp, Exploratory, or Level Up process.
- **PDF** - Create a one sheet PDF that can be easily shared with anyone via email or link.
This process will continue to evolve as we move forward with more blueprints. This set of instructions is designed to focus on fleshing out as many blueprints as possible, providing areas and elements for each, but then iterating upon actions and other links, videos, and resources with future versions--we will shift the process as we progress.
