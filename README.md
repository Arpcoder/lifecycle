# API Lifecycle & Governance Blueprints
This is a project to distill down many views of a modern lifecycle into many re-usable elements and actions organized into blueprints that provide a series of steps within a specific dimension of the API lifecycle.

**Workspace:** https://apis.how/

We are still working on ways to add to and evolve the content available here, add a visual layer, and play around with different ways of presenting them, helping reduce information overload and make it easier to discover and put to work across the API lifecycle.

## Blueprints
Here are the blueprints, or API lifecycle and governance concepts that we are working on as part of this effort. Each blueprint has an ideation board, issue dicussion, and a source of truth to help move forward each version of the blueprints.


### Introductory
These are a handful of high-level introductory blueprints meant for the widest possible audience.

- **What is an API** ([Ideation](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO969IsE=/)) ([Discussion](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/issues/147)) ([Truth](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/blob/main/blueprints/what-is-an-api.md))
- **History of APIs** ([Ideation](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO979MjQ=/)) ([Discussion](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/issues/148)) ([Truth](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/blob/main/blueprints/history-of-apis.md))
- **History of Web APIs** ([Ideation](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO969IgY=/)) ([Discussion](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/issues/150)) ([Truth](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/blob/main/blueprints/history-of-web-apis.md))
- **What is API-First** ([Ideation](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO97f0Is=/)) ([Discussion](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/issues/149)) ([Truth](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/blob/main/blueprints/what-is-api-first.md))

### Where to Start
These are some of the common answers to enterprise organizations asking where they should start.

- **WLandscape Mapping** ([Ideation](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVO8kikYU=/)) ([Discussion](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/issues/154)) ([Truth](https://github.com/postman-open-technologies/lifecycle/blob/main/blueprints/landscape-mapping.md))

## Structure
Blueprints are meant to provide very simple (1-2 pages) of guidance pertaining to a specific aspect of API operations, providing core concepts that can be consumed directly, or used as the core of blog posts, videos, white papers, boos, and other content. Here is a snapshot of the blueprint structure:

- Blueprints
    - Areas
        - Elements
            - Actions

Blueprints are meant to focus on a a specific concept, breaking that concept down into unique areas, but then refererncing common reusable elements that possess actions a user can take as a result of what they have learned along the way. There are additional links, questions, videos, and other related resources involved, but for now this provides a quick snapshot of the structure.

## Process
The process we are using to move blueprints forward is an ever evolving one, but to help encourage participation across the team, and even from the community, here are steps we are taking to create new blueprints, and iterate upon existing ones.

- **Ideation** - Use a miro board to get all the concepts on the table in a visual way.
- **Discussion** - Use Github issue to discuss each concept as we iterate upon.
- **Markdown** - Use individual markdown files as the source of truth for each version.
- **Research** - Conduct research, gather references to concepts we want to include.
- **Team** - Engage across Open Tech and other Postman teams for feedback on blueprints.
- **Customers** - Provide anonymized references to customer conversations across blueprints.
- **Breaking Changes** - Provide references to Breaking Changes discussions across blueprints.
- **Analyst** - Provide reference to analyst materials that support elements across blueprints.

This process will continue to evolve as we move forward with more blueprints. This set of instructions is designed to focus on fleshing out as many blueprints as possible, providing areas and elements for each, but then iterating upon actions and other links, videos, and resources with future versions--we will shift the process as we progress.
