The Postman API enables you to sync any OpenAPI you are authoring via the Postman platform with any other system. Allowing for seamless integration of all changes made by teams within Postman with other design, development, and management services and tooling. Enabling you to author OpenAPI within the Postman platform, or outside of the platform, while allowing you to still effectively manage the API across the API lifecycle using Postman.
