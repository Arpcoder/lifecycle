Under the API section of a Postman workspace you can choose to create a new API using the OpenAPI specification. Creating a starter OpenAPI that can then be versioned, edited, comment, and moved forward in a collaborative way across team members in a dedicated work. The API Builder is a great place to create a new OpenAPI because it can then be synced to other locations via Git or the API, while also making it available for other teams via workspaces, or the general public using a public workspace.
