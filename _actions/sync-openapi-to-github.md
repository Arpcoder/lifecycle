Postman seamlessly integrates with Github allowing for APIs, and versions of APIs to be synced with a specific repository and branch. This allows for a lot of flexibility regarding where an OpenAPI is being edited, and allows for an API to be managed and used within Postman, but then also used across the API lifecycle within external services and tooling. You can configure integration for each individual API and the syncing will occur automatically whenever a change is made on the Postman or the Github side, providing two-way updates as they occur.
