OpenAPIs can be authored in open source editors outside of the Postman platform, leveraging existing open source solutions for creating, designing, and managing OpenAPIs. Open source solutions can be used instead of Postman API Builder or in tandem with the platform solution, allowing for flexibility when it comes to authoring OpenAPIs, leveraging the platform when it makes sense, and putting open source to work on teams where having access through an open source interface might make more sense.
