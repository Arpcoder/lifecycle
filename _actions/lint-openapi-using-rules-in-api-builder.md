Currently you cannot applying standardized linting rules within the Postman API builder, but design time linting in the Postman API builder is currently under development, will be available in beta within a month, and we should have something for customers to use by the end of the year. Currently you will find additional links to our OpenAPI linting rules project site and repo, as well as a public workspace that contains a handful of collections that provide rules as well as script based linting at develop and build time. They are not replacement for design time linting of OpenAPI, but provide the ability to automate linting across the API lifecycle. We will update this page as soon as we see linting within the Postman API Builder released, and will make sure to publish a story abou tit.
