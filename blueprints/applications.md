# Applications
APIs are used to deliver resources and digital capabilities across multiple types of applications, providing what is needed to power many different web, mobile, and device applications, as well as system-to-system integration and automation. How the enterprise sees applications and integrations evolves once they begin shifting towards an API-first way of looking at operations, demonstrating how APIs are behind every digital application we depend on today.

## Types
APIs have powered applications since the beginning of compute, but the current breed of web APIs found its roots in aggregating content for web applications, but then quickly expanded to mobile, devices, back to the desktop, and even the network beneath our applications.
