# Future-Proof
Minimizing risk and making the future as predictable as possible is the desire of any enterprise organization, and the best way to protect any company against the future is to be able to respond to change and the unknown unknowns in an API-first way. Reducing the legacy baggage you possess, ensuring your teams are always iterating and innovating, while embracing and defining the shape and velocity at which the future arrives. Using APIs to more rapidly iterate and map out change as it is happening, allowing teams to respond to whatever comes your way, and come out of challenges ahead of the competition.
