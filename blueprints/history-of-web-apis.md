# History of Web APIs
While taking shape for several decades, modern web APis began to take their current form during the e-commerce and social networking evolution of the early 21st century. Pushing what was possible when it comes to buying and selling in a digital work, but then also realizing that consumers are a very social creature, and weâ€™d want to bring our friends, family, and followers along for the ride.

## Commerce
Early web APIs escaped from the controlled service oriented architecture (SOA) experiment that was occurring within the enterprise and began to be applied to sales, products, affiliates, auctions, and the other expanding areas of the e-commerce shift that was occurring online.

## Social
The digital experience was rapidly becoming a social affair, with images, links, and other digital resources become more sharable via APIs, but also by expanding the use of APIs to define our profiles, connections, and networks where we are sharing these images and links.
