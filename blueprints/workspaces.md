# Workspaces

API workspaces are to the API lifecycle, as Github repositories are to the software development lifecycle, and while they are separate, there is actually a symbiotic relationship between repositories and workspaces that help move forward each API along a well-known lifecycle. Workspaces provide a single place to design, develop, and manage APIs using OpenAPI, GraphQL, or WSDL, and manage documentation, mock servers, testing, and security using collections--providing a collaborative location for teams to move APIs forward.

## Contents

API workspaces are often compared to Git repositories until you begin to understand how more precise and relevant to the API lifecycle the contents are. Each workspace contains APIs artifacts, collections used to power mock servers, documentation, and testing, as well as individual environments for development, staging, and production environments, and monitors for automating the production and consumption of APIs. Once you begin to see hundreds of individual API workspaces all equipped with what is needed to design, develop, deploy, and manage APIs, all existing and operating independently to orchestrate a single enterprise operation, you begin to see what a modern API factory floor looks like. API workspaces have everything you need to produce and consume APIs, through APIs and integrations these dedicated workspaces can be used to power enterprise operations using internal, infrastructure, and 3rd party APIs to operate the factory floor each day.

*   [**Collection**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-5468c6eb-c110-4216-b65b-df0415513b6b) - A machine-readable artifact that acts as a container for storing and organizing multiple API requests, providing an executable, self-documented reference for a complete API, a subset of an API, as well as workflows containing multiple requests from across many different APIs in a specific order, with a precise business function.
*   [**APIs**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/) - Providing programmatic interfaces for a variety of desktop, web, mobile, device, and other applications using HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, TCP, MQTT, and other protocols, while supporting a mix of patterns like REST, RPC, GraphQL, and event-driven to meet the growing demands of increasingly digital organizations.
*   [**Environments**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-811d5926-7928-4762-926b-e4dd61954963) - Machine-readable environments for APIs allow for abstracting away common elements of an API environment from the definition of each API, allowing different environments to be paired with OpenAPI and collections for each API at design, development, and build time.
*   [**Monitor**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-c6ce1a5d-5732-4ad5-9ac0-34bd7b895c01) - Monitoring any process across API operations defined as a collection, then bundled with any environment, setting a schedule for the execution of the collection, and viewing or publishing of the results to any other location, providing a very wide definition of what monitoring can mean across API operations.
    

## Visibility

The visibility of API workspaces is key to defining enterprise operations, providing the ability to keep work around APIs private amongst internal teams, available to trusted partners, as well as fully opening up for engagement with public consumers. This level of control over the visibility of not just APIs, but also the work that is occurring around them is critical for us to move beyond the past anxieties regarding public and private API access. The question isn't should we do public or private APIs, we must be doing both, and we need our API platform to support us in making this as easy as possible. Providing access to digital resources and capabilities is what APIs are all about, but being API-first also means you have full control over what is private or public, who has access to these resources, and you enjoy full visibility over what they have access to. Allowing enterprise organizations to be more confident regarding the visibility across their operations, and lower barriers to entry when it comes to access to digital resources and capabilities without compromising privacy, security, and reliability of operations.

*   [**Private**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/) - Keeping something only accessible internally by a designated team of stakeholders, keeping workspaces, API, collections, environments, and monitors only accessible to team members who have been invited to access, then further delegating access control based upon their role, ensuring they can only view, or possibly edit all the artifacts and operations around any API with a private visibility.
*   [**Partner**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/) - An established relationship between two organizations around a common activity, leveraging APIs as the way in which data, content, media, and other digital resources and capabilities are made available, helping ensure the partnership benefits both parties involved, but leverages APIs to ensure interoperability and access to partner benefits.
*   [**Public**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/) - Designating a workspace, APIs, collections, environments, and monitors having a public visibility that makes them discoverable via the public API network and search engines, increasing the audience for an API by making it available publicly, while still limiting who can actually edit artifacts and change configuration, limiting engagement with public consumers to watches, forks, and commenting on APIs and collections.
    

## Engagement

API workspaces are changing how API producers engage with consumers, dictating how teams within the enterprise work, and when a partner or 3rd party contributors will be able to join in the conversation. API workspaces give us control over the visibility of APIs and the operations around them and give us new insight into how teams are engaging with each other, and external consumers are watching and working with APIs, going beyond classic API management to drive engagement. Workspaces give us visibility into how teams are doing what they do and showcase the contributions of external actors when APIs are made accessible outside the firewall. API workspaces give us an entirely new approach that builds upon the developer portal practices popularized over the last decade, but then further expands and adapts it to the realities that exist on the ground of API operations today.

*   [**Contributors**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/) - The individual contributors to the APIs, collections, and other artifacts and activity occurring within workspaces, tracking and acknowledging the contribution of team members and 3rd party contributors who are helping make small or large changes to any aspect of what is happening in a workspace.
*   [**Team**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/) - The team of people who are behind API operations, providing name, role, and other relevant details about who they are and what they will be contributing to API operations, helping manage the human side of operations, allowing hundreds or thousands of team members to be organized and managed for optimal deliver and consumption of APIs across operations.
*   [**Watch**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-e933db77-d17f-4ba8-94cd-30de8ea19a35) - Watching of some element of API operations, allowing team members, partners, or public users to signal they want to receive notifications of any change to an API and it's supporting elements, making API operations more observable and something that all stakeholders are able to stay in tune with as they evolve and change.
*   [**Activity**](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-43ab9dd3-a7d9-484d-b52d-67ade5820dcf) - The changes made to any aspect of operations by team members, providing observability into when APIs, mock servers, documentation, testing, monitors, and other critical elements of API operations are changed, configured-- helping give a log of everything that happens at the operational level.
