# Capabilities
A capability is a simple representation of something that can be accomplished digitally, defining a valuable process, workflow, model, or algorithm that is valuable to internal or external consumers. Often defined by one or many API requests or subscriptions that reflect a specific business capability, representing a single product offering, or bundling multiple capabilities together for a specific digital product experience.
