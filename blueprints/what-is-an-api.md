# What is an API?
In an internet-connected world, desktop, web, mobile, and device applications are designed for humans to use, while APIs are designed for systems, applications, and integrations to put to work. Websites and APIs both do the same things, like return data, content, images, video, and put algorithms to work. The only difference is that APIs don’t return all the details that are needed to make things look pretty for the human eye—you only get the raw data and other machine-readable information needed behind the scenes to put the resources being delivered to work.
