# Devices in our Physical World
Once it was discovered that simple low-cost web APIs would work for low-latency mobile applications, developers began using the same approaches to sending messages and data between common everyday objects. Connecting devices across our personal and professional lives together, and bringing the online world into the physical world, helping automate and optimize how we do business.

## Internet of Things
Cameras, sensors, drones, and other types of Internet-connected devices are being applied across a range of industries, introducing “smart” capabilities into existing real-world processes, and leveraging APIs to send and receive data from the cloud. Tapping into the recent use of APIs makes cloud infrastructure available, and many of the APIs are being used by our iPhone and Android mobile applications, but are now used to power everyday objects.

- **Manufacturing** - In the manufacturing industry, the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) allows for improvements in efficiency, cost, and safety. Networked sensors can be attached to physical equipment and assets. These sensors gather data so that operators can perform condition monitoring and measure overall equipment effectiveness. With the information provided by the sensors, operators can monitor machine temperature, vibrations, and sound frequencies, and they can use this data to perform predictive maintenance on equipment that gives abnormal readings. Predictive maintenance gives operators the opportunity to detect and repair problems before the equipment fails. Operators can also monitor machine run time, operating speed, and product output, which allows them to measure and improve production efficiency. IIoT sensors can also be used for supply chain improvements, such as locating inventory and controlling environmental conditions during storage and transport. Workers can use wearable technology to monitor their heart rate, skin temperature, and location to prevent overexertion, falls, and other safety threats.

APIs provide data to Internet-connected objects and gather data from those objects for use in desktop, web, and mobile applications. APIs are how every business sector is being reshaped as part of an ongoing digital transformation that every enterprise organization is facing today. Low-cost web infrastructure used to power more efficient and reliable APIs is how the Internet-connected landscape of the future will be defined.
