# Devices in our Physical World
Once it was discovered that simple low-cost web APIs would work for low-latency mobile applications, developers began using the same approaches to sending messages and data between common everyday objects. Connecting devices across our personal and professional lives together, and bringing the online world into the physical world, helping automate and optimize how we do business.

## Internet of Things
Cameras, sensors, drones, and other types of Internet-connected devices are being applied across a range of industries, introducing “smart” capabilities into existing real-world processes, and leveraging APIs to send and receive data from the cloud. Tapping into the recent use of APIs make cloud infrastructure available, and many of the APIs are being used by our iPhone and Android mobile applications, but are now used to power everyday object.

APIs provide data to Internet-connected objects and gather data from those objects for use in desktop, web, and mobile applications. APIs are how every business sector is being reshaped as part of an ongoing digital transformation that every enterprise organization is facing today. Low-cost web infrastructure used to power more efficient and reliable APIs is how the Internet-connected landscape of the future will be defined.
