# Shift Left

In the early years of software development, applications were typically programmed and tested by the same people. Over the years, organizations started to add more planning and structure to the way they managed the software development lifecycle, breaking down the lifecycle into concrete steps so that different steps could be handled by different teams. After following this model for a decade or two, many companies began to realize the cost of having the testing phase so late in the lifecycle, and started to shift testing to the left by integrating it into the earlier phases of development.

### Software Development Lifecycle Evolution

- **Waterfall** - The waterfall model comes from industries such as construction and manufacturing, where the cost of materials is a major consideration. In the 1970s, many organizations started to adopt the waterfall model for their software development lifecycle. In this model, a project is broken down into several phases, and progress flows in one direction. Each phase must be complete before the project can move on to the next phase. The waterfall model phases include defining requirements, analysis, design, coding, testing, and deployment. The different phases can be handled by various teams or roles, including product managers, designers, engineering, quality assurance (QA), and user experience (UX). Waterfall became the dominant model for software companies during the 1970s and 1980s, and is still used by many organizations.
