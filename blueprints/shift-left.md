# Shift Left


## Software Development Lifecycle

In the early years of software development, applications were typically programmed and tested by the same people. Over the years, organizations started to add more planning and structure to the way they managed the software development lifecycle. Different steps in the process could be handled by different teams.

- **Waterfall** - The waterfall model comes from industries such as construction and manufacturing, where the cost of materials is a major consideration. In the 1970s, many organizations started to adopt the waterfall model for their software development lifecycle. In this model, a project is broken down into several phases, and progress flows in one direction. Using the waterfall model, development work can be distributed across multiple teams that specialize in different areas, and each phase must be complete before the project can move on to the next phase. The waterfall model phases include defining requirements, analysis, design, coding, testing, and deployment.  A product manager can work on the early analysis and design steps, and then hand off the requirements to a developer, who codes the application. The developer then gives the code to a quality assurance tester, who tests the application and looks for defects. If the tester doesn't find any defects, an operator can deploy or distribute the application. Waterfall became the dominant model for organizations developing software during this decade.
