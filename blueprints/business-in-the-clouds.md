# Business in the Clouds
Web APIs were increasingly being used for more industrial-grade purposes, making common building blocks of information technology (IT) available as simple XML or JSON APIs. Further commoditizing essential technical resources that businesses were depending on, shifting how we deploy and pay for our IT infrastructure while making them more elastic and scalable to meet the increasing demands being placed on our enterprises by web and mobile applications.

## Early Cloud APIs

- **S3**: In the early 2000s, Amazon was already a successful e-commerce platform, and around that time the company began to focus on making their internal development more efficient. Developers frequently built new databases, compute resources, and storage resources every time they worked on a new project. To save time and resources, developers began to build common resources that any internal team could consume and use for their own projects. Over time, this practice turned the Amazon platform into a set of APIs that combined infrastructure services with intuitive developer tools. In 2002, Amazon released an early version of their web service, which included SOAP and XML interfaces for the Amazon product catalog along with the same infrastructure services they were using internally. In 2006, Amazon officially released Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the API for their Simple Storage Service (S3). S3 is an object storage solution that provides near-infinite storage for developers, allowing them to pay for each gigabyte they use. By storing objects in S3, developers can access their data from anywhere on the Internet at any time, instead of relying on static HTTP objects that depend on the resources and uptime of a specific server. S3 made it possible to use an API to create and manage infrastructure, instead of using APIs for data management only.
