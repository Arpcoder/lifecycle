# Our Lives Going Mobile
Mobile phones have been around since the 20th century, but in 2007 everything would change with the introduction of the iPhone from Apple. These new mobile devices would popularize a new category of Internet connection applications that weâ€™d carry around with us in our pockets, requiring an entirely new set of digital resources, and unlocking an unlimited realm of possibilities when it came to new types of Internet-enabled digital capabilities.

## Devices
There have been many different mobile devices and operating systems to emerge in the last couple of decades, but the iPhone from Apple and Android OS backed by a variety of mobile devices continue to dominate the mobile landscape.

- **iPhone**: In 2004, a team of a thousand Apple employees began work on a secret project. Steve Jobs had noted that with the rising popularity of personal digital assistants (PDAs), many people were carrying around multiple devices: a mobile phone, an iPod, and a PDA. Apple collaborated with wireless carrier Cingular (now AT&T) for 30 months to develop the first iPhone, which aimed to combine these three devices into one. In January 2007, Apple first announced the iPhone, and it was released the following June. Unlike other mobile phones at the time, the iPhone's interface was designed around its touch screen and singular button, and its music player resembled the iPod that was already familiar to many people. The iPhone provided screen space that made web browsing, sending and reading emails, and viewing maps easier than they had ever been on a mobile phone. A year after the first iPhone launch, the App Store opened, allowing third party developers to make their applications available to any iPhone user.

## Resources
Early mobile application developers realize that they could deliver the digital resources they needed on their mobile applications, and waves of API providers emerged to provide the essential digital resources we would be needing to power the growing spectrum of mobile applications being installed to the desktop of these powerful mobile computing devices.
