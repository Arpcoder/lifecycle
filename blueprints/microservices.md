# Microservices
The benefits realized from doing APIs have manifested themselves in many different ways, but none rise to the value introduced over the last five years of redefining the enterprise using microservices. The microservices journey has helped us understand who we are as an organization, giving us the vocabulary for defining the technical, business, and human elements of doing business in the Internet age. Helping us not just decompose the monolithic enterprise infrastructure that has accumulated over the last few decades, but also reconfigure our operations to better serve the future we envision.

## Enterprise Building Blocks
Microservices are the Lego building blocks we need to understand what digital resources and capabilities compose our enterprise operations and provide us with the building blocks to build any configuration of application, integration, and orchestration we will need to meet the demands of our business in a digital age.

- **Templates** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Synchronous** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod. 
- **Asynchronous** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Risk** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Reward** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Lifecycle** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.

Microservices are not the silver bullet to solve all internal enterprise challenges, but it does provide a proven approach to how we break up and organize our digital resources and capabilities. Providing teams with a clear definition of a class of API that is only available internally, behind the enterprise facade.
