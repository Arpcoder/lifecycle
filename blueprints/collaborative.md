Doing business in the cloud means you can collaborate with internal teams, partner stakeholders, and even the public when it comes to producing and consuming APIs. Connecting technical and non-technical stakeholders when it comes to delivering and applying the digital resources and capabilities that are needed to do business. Allowing tens, hundreds, or even thousands of people to collaborate when it comes to building and using the digital resources and cpabiities that shape how we do business today, but also tomorrow.
