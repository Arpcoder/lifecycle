# Productivity
Productivity is achieved in an API-first world through well-defined workspaces, that possess everything you need to engage with an API throughout its wellâ€“defined lifecycle. Organizing the enterprise API factory floor into productive workspaces that possess the artifacts, documentation, mock servers, environments, monitors, and other building blocks of API operations.

- **Workspaces** - Everything you need to engage with APsI is available via collaborative workspaces that posses the access controls needed to prevent undesired outcomes.
- **Collections** - The collection is a machine-readable, executable, and documented unit of work, providing everything you need to define a unit of business value in an API-first world.
- **Lifecycle** - There is a known lifecycle that allows all contributors to deliver the best possible API in a short amount of time, standardizing how APIs are delivered to optimize productivity.
- **Discovery** - All of API operations are discoverable, making teams, APIs, and operations available via search and discovery, ready for use across any stage of the API lifecycle.
