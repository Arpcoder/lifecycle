# History of APIs
APIs are not new, and are something that emerged in the earliest days of digital computing back in the 1950s, but are something that has evolved to meet the needs of a variety of business sectors, and have seen a massive standardization and growth as a result of the web and emergence of mobile networks.

## Planting Early Seeds
​​The compute and network origins of APIs begins in the early days of computer technology, realizing that this new technology has the greatest impact when used in a collaborative way.

- **SAGE**: In 1954, the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) began its six-year development to be used as an early warning air defense system. SAGE was developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) with some funding from the United States Air Force. A SAGE center could track up to 400 airplanes, using flight plans to differentiate between friendly and enemy aircraft. There were 23 SAGE centers, and each required at least 100 operators. The centers were able to communicate over telephone lines using modems, which started to become commercially available as part of the SAGE project. The first SAGE center came online in 1959.
- **SABRE**: In 1964, IBM built upon SAGE to develop Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment (SABRE), an air travel reservation system for American Airlines. This system connected 2000 air terminals across 60 cities by telephone lines. SABRE is one of the earliest examples of a real-time operating system (RTOS). An RTOS is an application designed to process data in real time at a consistent pace.
- **ARPANET**: The early stages of the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) began in 1966, developed by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense. Larry Roberts and Thomas Marill created the first wide-area network connection, linking the TX-2 computer at MIT to the AN/FSQ-32 computer in Santa Monica over a telephone line. The slow speeds, cost, and inefficiency of sending data across telephone lines led Larry Roberts to incorporate packet switching, a concept introduced by Donald Davies at the 1967 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, into ARPANET. ARPANET was the first large-scale network to use packet switching, which groups data into packets and sends them across a digital network. A packet includes a header, which the networking hardware uses to direct the packet, and a payload, which contains the packet's main message.

## Laying the Foundation
By the 1970s the earliest networks were being established, resulting in the need to share files, communicate via messages, and better explore how early APIs can be used for business.

- FTP
- EDI
- Email

## Conducting Business
The business value of early APIs were clear, there was just much more work to be done when it comes to standardizing how we would be able to communicate via the new networks we had developed.

- Corba
- XML
- SOA

As the web emerged, many industry forces came together to formalize XML specifications in service of a SOA vision for industry, but the simpler, more low-cost, and increasingly ubiquitous web would provide a much more powerful approach to delivering the digital resources and capabilities we would need.
