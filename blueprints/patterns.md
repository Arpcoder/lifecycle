# Patterns
There are many common patterns in use across the API sector, but the foundation of the modern API toolbox continues to be REST. with GraphQL, Websockets, and increasingly gRPC. The line between pattern and protocol is often a blurry one, but there are a handful of well-known patterns that act as the cornerstone for API applications and integrations, depending on which industry or layer of the enterprise an API is operating in.

## Style, Formats, and Protocols

- **REST** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **GraphQL** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Websockets** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **gRPC** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Kafka** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Microservices** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **WebSub (PubSub)** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod.
- **Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)** - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuelit, sed do eiusmod.

Some of these merely provide a style to follow, where others are standardized formats and protocols, but provide a set of agreed upon constraints that can be applied using a specific, or mix of transport protocols to consumers, brokers, and other stakeholders.
