# Innovation
Allowing for and incentivizing innovation to exist across all teams is important to provide the room for experimentation and engagement with API consumers in new and interesting ways. Without explicitly investing in innovation it can often go overlooked, where in reality it should be baked into the regular process and make it a default part of the API lifecycle and how teams work together. Leaving innovation the default way that teams produce and consume APIs, but also make the API lifecycle much richer, consistent, and meeting business needs.
