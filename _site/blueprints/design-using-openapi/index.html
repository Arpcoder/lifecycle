         <p>This blueprint enters the API lifecycle in what is widely considered to be an API design first way, ensuring that your API effort is properly defined as you leverage OpenAPI to design, mock, document, and iterate upon the design of your API before actually writing any code. This approach is desirable because it allows for API producer and even consumer stakeholders to be involved in what an API will do early on in the process, before code is actually written. This blueprint provides one of the more optimal and forward leaning approaches to embracing a standardized API lifecycle across your teams, helping ensure the lifecycle is driven by machine readable artifacts, and has clear steps moving those artifacts from design to production in a way that everyone can understand and collaborate around.</p>

            <p>Ensuring that operations supporting an API is properly defined, as well as what is needed to properly design and bring an API to life. A little planning and organization at this step of an APIs journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications that depend on this internal, partner, or public API.</p>

            <p>Mocking how an API works and behaves provides an effective way for teams to collaborate, communicate, and iterate as part of the design of an API, but also is something that can be used as part of testing, or just providing a sandbox environment for API consumers to learn before they actually begin working with any API in production.</p>

Performance tests can be defined as individual tests using collections, pulling from one or many individual API paths and measuring the time it takes for the response to be sent, providing a test that can be run manually, scheduled across multiple geographic regions, or executed as part of a CI/CD pipeline, helping ensure an API is always meeting it's expected performance benchmarks.</li>

            <p>All tests applied to an API should be monitored on a logical schedule and from relevant geographic regions, monitoring that APIs aren't breaking their contract, falling below their agreed upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible.</p>

            <p>Establishing a well defined process for deploy an API helps teams deploy new APIs, as well as each future iteration of an API in a consistent and repeatable way, making sure APIs are deployed using known development, staging, production, other agreed upon stages that actively put to work the other elements like documentation, testing, while contributing to observability.</p>

            <p>The ability to discover APIs at all stages of the API lifecycle is key to reduce redundancy across operations, helping teams find existing APIs before they develop new ones, and properly match API consumers with the right APIs, supporting documentation, relevant workflows, and the feedback loops that exist as part of the operation of APIs internally within the enterprise, or externally with 3rd party developers.</p>

            <p>Having a plan for the eventual retirement and ultimate deprecation of an API, or for specific paths or versions of an API should be a part of every API lifecycle, even when there is no plan for deprecation there should be a process in place for setting expectations for how long an API will be supported, as well as formal process to follow once retirement comes into view on the horizon.</p>
