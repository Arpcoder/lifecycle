<main class="flex-shrink-0"><h1 id="workspaces">Workspaces</h1>

<p>API workspaces are to the API lifecycle, as Github repositories are to the software development lifecycle, and while they are separate, there is actually a symbiotic relationship between repositories and workspaces that help move forward each API along a well-known lifecycle. Workspaces provide a single place to design, develop, and manage APIs using OpenAPI, GraphQL, or WSDL, and manage documentation, mock servers, testing, and security using collections–providing a collaborative location for teams to move APIs forward.</p>

<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-5468c6eb-c110-4216-b65b-df0415513b6b"><strong>Collection</strong></a> - A machine-readable artifact that acts as a container for storing and organizing multiple API requests, providing an executable, self-documented reference for a complete API, a subset of an API, as well as workflows containing multiple requests from across many different APIs in a specific order, with a precise business function.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/"><strong>APIs</strong></a> - Providing programmatic interfaces for a variety of desktop, web, mobile, device, and other applications using HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, TCP, MQTT, and other protocols, while supporting a mix of patterns like REST, RPC, GraphQL, and event-driven to meet the growing demands of increasingly digital organizations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-811d5926-7928-4762-926b-e4dd61954963"><strong>Environments</strong></a> - Machine-readable environments for APIs allow for abstracting away common elements of an API environment from the definition of each API, allowing different environments to be paired with OpenAPI and collections for each API at design, development, and build time.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-c6ce1a5d-5732-4ad5-9ac0-34bd7b895c01"><strong>Monitor</strong></a> - Monitoring any process across API operations defined as a collection, then bundled with any environment, setting a schedule for the execution of the collection, and viewing or publishing of the results to any other location, providing a very wide definition of what monitoring can mean across API operations.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="visibility">Visibility</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/"><strong>Private</strong></a> - Keeping something only accessible internally by a designated team of stakeholders, keeping workspaces, API, collections, environments, and monitors only accessible to team members who have been invited to access, then further delegating access control based upon their role, ensuring they can only view, or possibly edit all the artifacts and operations around any API with a private visibility.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/"><strong>Partner</strong></a> - An established relationship between two organizations around a common activity, leveraging APIs as the way in which data, content, media, and other digital resources and capabilities are made available, helping ensure the partnership benefits both parties involved, but leverages APIs to ensure interoperability and access to partner benefits.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/"><strong>Public</strong></a> - Designating a workspace, APIs, collections, environments, and monitors having a public visibility that makes them discoverable via the public API network and search engines, increasing the audience for an API by making it available publicly, while still limiting who can actually edit artifacts and change configuration, limiting engagement with public consumers to watches, forks, and commenting on APIs and collections.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="engagement">Engagement</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/"><strong>Contributors</strong></a> - The individual contributors to the APIs, collections, and other artifacts and activity occurring within workspaces, tracking and acknowledging the contribution of team members and 3rd party contributors who are helping make small or large changes to any aspect of what is happening in a workspace.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/"><strong>Team</strong></a> - The team of people who are behind API operations, providing name, role, and other relevant details about who they are and what they will be contributing to API operations, helping manage the human side of operations, allowing hundreds or thousands of team members to be organized and managed for optimal deliver and consumption of APIs across operations.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-e933db77-d17f-4ba8-94cd-30de8ea19a35"><strong>Watch</strong></a> - Watching of some element of API operations, allowing team members, partners, or public users to signal they want to receive notifications of any change to an API and it’s supporting elements, making API operations more observable and something that all stakeholders are able to stay in tune with as they evolve and change.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-open-technologies-lifecycle/documentation/12959542-43ab9dd3-a7d9-484d-b52d-67ade5820dcf"><strong>Activity</strong></a> - The changes made to any aspect of operations by team members, providing observability into when APIs, mock servers, documentation, testing, monitors, and other critical elements of API operations are changed, configured– helping give a log of everything that happens at the operational level.</li>
