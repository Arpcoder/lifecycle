         <p>Every organization creating APIs has an API lifecycle, whether they know it or not. The difference separating high-performing API companies from those with inconsistent results is a thoughtful and practiced approach. Below are key aspects of the API lifecycle, common characterists worth focusing on, and how Postmanâ€™s API platform supports each. </p>

            <p>Before starting a new API endeavor, it is crucial to discover if the solution to the problem you're trying to solve already exists. Building on already existing functionality brings products and services to market faster. Postman has several elements that make this discovery step easier.</p>

available via search helps make sure that APIs can be found by consumers, but also by other producers who are looking to develop similar APIs, making search for APIs, as well as the operations around each API a critical aspect of the API lifecycle that should be considered as early on in the design and development of an API, but at least as it is deployed into production. </li>

            <p>Designing an interface is one of the most critical steps in the API's lifecycle. It involves making decisions on how the interface will look and feel when used. American software engineer Grady Booch calls these decisions "significant", where significance is measured by the cost of change. Once your API has its first user, the cost of changing that interface increases significantly. Applying the appropriate rigor at this stage of the lifecycle will decrease the likelihood that change is necessary later. This includes, but is not limited to, defining performance, functionality, and security expectations.</p>

            <p>Publishing is the act of making an *implementation* available that executes a service's interface in an accessible environment. This act requires more than just pushing a deployment to a cloud host. Publishing an API entails communicating documentation and, in some cases, code to the appropriate audience.</p>

API networks all organizations, groups, and teams to establish private catalogs of APIs, collections, and the other artifacts and elements around them, making it easier for producers and consumers to

Security tests can be defined for any API using executable and shareable collections, testing for common OWASP vulnerabilities, as well as other more custom scenarios or business approaches, providing a single or suite of security tests that can be manually run, schedule across multiple regions, or executed as part of a CI/CD pipeline, automating security consistently across APIs. </li>
