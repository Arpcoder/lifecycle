            <p style="text-align: left;">Test automation is essential for delivering reliable and consistent APIs at scale across the enterprise. This is a blueprint for walking through the base of how test automation can work as part of a well defined API lifecycle, helping teams standardize how they approach testing APIs.</p>

         <p>This blueprint focuses just on the test automation portion of the API lifecycle, highlighting the different types of tests that can be run, how monitors can be used to automate those tests on a schedule from multiple regions, and then how to tap into the observability opportunities that exist when it comes to test automation. Test automation should provide you with a 50K foot view of how testing works in conjunction with monitors, and what observability is available by default, published using visualizer, or introduced through integrations with external solutions, providing many different ways of being able to see and understand test automation for API operations.</p>

            <p>The most important first step of any API lifecycle is to make sure the operations around an API are properly defined, laying the foundation for being able to effectively design and bring an API to life, while also establishing a known place, or places to go to get all the information you need regarding each individual API, or groups of APIs. A little planning and organization at this early step of the API journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications and integrations that will depend on each internal, partner, or public API being delivered.</p>

            <p>All tests applied to an API should be monitored on a logical schedule and from relevant geographic regions, monitoring that APIs aren't breaking their contract, falling below their agreed upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible.</p>

            <p>Tests can be automated using a CI/CD pipeline, allowing for test to be executed every time a commit or pull request is made against a repo. Allowing tests to be run against any instance of an API, ensuring that any API being deployed has not broken it's contract, and the API does what is expected.</p>

aspects of the software development lifecycle, APIs benefit from well defined, repeatable CI/CD pipelines to deploy, test, automate, and orchestrate throughout the API lifecycle, publishing APIs to development, staging, production, and other stages, but then also ensuring other elements like publishing of documentation, and tests are baked into the process.  </li>

         <p>This blueprint is meant to provide a standardized approach to automating the testing of APIs across operations as part of a standardized API lifecycle. Each element within this blueprint works to provide a simple overview of what is involved across the entire life of an API, with more detail present on the detail page for each element (if you are viewing this on the API lifecycle project site). If you are reading this via a PDF or printed version you can visit the landing page for this blueprint to access more information and view specific actions you might possibly consider taking as part of applying each element of this proposed lifecycle within your own operations. This blueprint is a living document and will continue to evolve and be added to over time based upon feedback from readers. If you have any questions, feedback, or feel like there is more information you need, feel free to jump on the Github discussion for this blueprint, or any of the individual elements present--the value this blueprint provides is actively defined by the feedback community members like you.</p>
