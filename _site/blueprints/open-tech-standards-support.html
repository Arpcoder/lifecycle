<p>Postman Open Technologies works with standards bodies to help move their specifications forward using open source specifications like OpenAPI and AsyncAPI, helping define common objects across those contracts using JSON Schema, and document and certify them via a publicly available workspace that the community can engage and work with.</p>

<p>We help our open standards and specification partners with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Team Profile</strong> - We want your organization to have a robust team profile in our network of 20M API producers and consumers..</li>
  <li><strong>Public Workspace</strong> - We can help you setup, configure, and drive attention to your public API standards workspace, and make it available via your public team profile, and embedded in your existing documentation and portal.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI Source of Truth</strong> - WE can provide feedback and guidance on managing OpenAPI for your standards.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenAPI Versioning</strong> - We want to help offer guidance when it comes to versioning your API standards over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Reference Documentation</strong> - We can help you automatically generate reference documentation for your standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Use Case Documentation</strong> - We can help you develop specific business use case documentation for your standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Github Syncing</strong> - We can help you sync your source of truth OpenAPI, and documentation to a public Github repository.</li>
  <li><strong>Mock Servers</strong> - We can help you develop mock servers for entire standard or for specific business use cases.</li>
  <li><strong>Certification</strong> - We can help you develop modular, sharable, executable tests to certify implementations of your standard.</li>
  <li><strong>Contributor Engagement</strong> - We can help speed up on-boarding, forking, watching, and engagement with your community stakeholders.</li>
  <li><strong>Feedback Loop</strong> - We can help you strengthen your feedback loop around your standards, and the specific properties of your standard, helping gather more precise feedback.</li>
</ul>

<p>With a team profile for your organization, and a public workspace for your standards, complete with OpenAPI contracts, reference and use case docs, as well as mock servers and certification tests, we can then help with some go to market actives on a regular basis that would help bring attention to your standard.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog Posts</strong> - We are happy to write regular stories about your standards, as long as we can map it to the real world business concerns of the industry you serve.</li>
  <li><strong>Live Stream</strong> - We have a weekly live stream we like to showcase real-time implementations of industry standards, helping our audience of 20M developers makes sense of standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Breaking Changes</strong> - We have a podcast focused on business and technology leadership that we’d like to invite your leadership, as well as those of your members to have a conversation.</li>
  <li><strong>Social Amplification</strong> - As a standards partner with Postman Open Technology team we are happy to help amplify the stories we produce together, as well as the news from your community.</li>
</ul>

<p>Postman is committed to helping increase our investment, but also help scale the communities investment in open standards, so we are happy to dedicate time each month from the team to brainstorm ideas with your organization, and find the best way to help add value to the great work you are already doing. It is important for us to have your standards as part of the Postman API Network, and after we get a workspace up and some storytelling under our belt, we’d love to explore other possibilities when it comes to baking your API standard into the API lifecycle and governance practices of your target audience—making it easy for developer within these industries to do the right thing when delivering new APIs.</p>

<p>Let’s get a regular time in the calendar to discuss some ideas!!</p>
