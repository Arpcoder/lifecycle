         <p>APIs behind web applications are often developed with it’s use beyond it’s immediate purpose within a single application, resulting in the need to reverse engineer, document, test, and move forward as a standardized API as part of a well known API lifecycle in the future. This is a common entry into the API lifecycle for an existing API, acknowledging that APIs will regularly be brought to life to support a specific need, but then eventually they should be standardized and made usable across multiple applications and integrations. The Postman Interceptor provides an effective way to capture traffic behind the web applications we use each day and route the traffic into a collection for cleaning up, documenting, and then potentially testing and monitoring as part of a formal API lifecycle. Providing a robust approach to rapidly mapping out API infrastructure behind our web applications, and then ensuring they are well documented and reliable for use beyond a single application.</p>

            <p>Ensuring that operations supporting an API is properly defined, as well as what is needed to properly design and bring an API to life. A little planning and organization at this step of an APIs journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications that depend on this internal, partner, or public API.</p>

Performance tests can be defined as individual tests using collections, pulling from one or many individual API paths and measuring the time it takes for the response to be sent, providing a test that can be run manually, scheduled across multiple geographic regions, or executed as part of a CI/CD pipeline, helping ensure an API is always meeting it's expected performance benchmarks. </li>

            <p>All tests applied to an API should be monitored on a logical schedule and from relevant geographic regions, monitoring that APIs aren't breaking their contract, falling below their agreed upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible.</p>

            <p>The ability to discover APIs at all stages of the API lifecycle is key to reduce redundancy across operations, helping teams find existing APIs before they develop new ones, and properly match API consumers with the right APIs, supporting documentation, relevant workflows, and the feedback loops that exist as part of the operation of APIs internally within the enterprise, or externally with 3rd party developers.</p>

networks allow for teams, APIs, collections, and other elements to be made available for searching and browsing by a public audience, helping API producers reach a larger audience, but also allowing consumers to quickly find the APIs and other resources they need in their applications and integrations, networking consumers with producers in an ongoing and collaborative way. </li>

         <p>This blueprint intends to provide a look at how you can bring an API into a standardized API lifecycle by reverse engineering API traffic using Postman Interceptor. Each element within this blueprint works to provide a simple overview of what is involved across the entire life of an API, with more detail present on the detail page for each element (if you are viewing this on the API lifecycle project site). If you are reading this via a PDF or printed version you can visit the landing page for this blueprint to access more information and view specific actions you might possibly consider taking as part of applying each element of this proposed lifecycle within your own operations. This blueprint is a living document and will continue to evolve and be added to over time based upon feedback from readers. If you have any questions, feedback, or feel like there is more information you need, feel free to jump on the Github discussion for this blueprint, or any of the individual elements present--the value this blueprint provides is actively defined by the feedback community members like you.</p>
