<main class="flex-shrink-0"><h1 id="what-is-an-api">What is an API?</h1>
<p>In an internet-connected world, desktop, web, mobile, and device applications are designed for humans to use, where APIs are designed for systems, applications, and integrations to be put to work. Websites and APIs both do the same things, like return data, content, images, videos, and put algorithms to work. The only difference is that APIs don’t return all the details that are needed to make things look pretty for the human eye—you only get the raw data and other machine-readable information needed behind the scenes to put the resources being delivered to work.</p>

<h1 id="unpacking-the-acronym">Unpacking the Acronym</h1>
<p>Let’s break down what an API is a little before we explore what they are capable of, understanding a bit more about how we interface to programmatically apply a variety of digital resources and capabilities:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>(A)pplication</strong> - You are “applying” something digital, oftentimes on the desktop, web, or via a mobile device, but today it really can be anywhere you want by connecting it to the Internet, bringing the web into our homes, workplaces, cars, and in the public sphere.</li>
  <li><strong>(P)rogramming</strong> - Allowing for something to be programmed, executed, and automated, making something that is repeatable and easy to use in software, allowing our physical and online world can be automated to do the things we can’t or don’t want to do.</li>
  <li><strong>(I)nterface</strong> - The point where two entities meet and interact, enabling communication between two systems, and applying digital resources and capabilities, networking servers and common everyday objects, allowing the world around us to interact.</li>
</ul>

<p>Application Programming Interfaces, or simply APIs are how you standardize, automate, and apply the digital resources and capabilities that define how how digital world goes around in the 21st century.</p>

<h2 id="useful-analogies">Useful Analogies</h2>
<p>When learning about abstract digital concepts it helps to lean on real-world analogies to help us make sense of the rapidly expanding digital landscape we are putting to work, or are putting us to work:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Restaurant Menu</strong> - APIs have been compared to a restaurant menu, providing you with a list of what is available, and providing a set of instructions for how to order the food you wish to order.</li>
  <li><strong>Utilities</strong> - APIs are often compared to your electricity, telephone, and plumbing, but applied to an endless mix of digital resources and capabilities which you access via your digital interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>APIs come in many shapes and sizes and can be difficult to see, but you are already using APIs many times each day to interact with friends, family, co-workers, customers, and many other people you encounter as part of your work.</p>
