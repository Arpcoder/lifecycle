<main class="flex-shrink-0"><h1 id="an-ad-hoc-landscape">An Ad Hoc Landscape</h1>
<p>In the fast-paced business environment that exists within almost every enterprise organization, there is a never-ending attraction towards defining digital resources and capabilities in a one-off fashion to support specific projects, applications, and integrations. Leaving a legacy trail of APIs that are often redundant and overlapping, but all in need of equal investment to support and keep reliable and delivering value for the business.</p>

<h2 id="common-distractions">Common Distractions</h2>
<p>There are plenty of distractions when it comes to enterprise operations, but there a common set of ways in which organizations lose their way when it comes to delivering, sustaining, and evolving their API landscape.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>One Project</strong> - It is easy to see APIs as just a subset of a project with clear start and completion dates, rather than seeing those APis as part of a larger enterprise system and something that should be discoverable and usable beyond just the project.</li>
  <li><strong>One Application</strong> - The needs of a specific web or mobile application are often proritized over seeing the APIs behind them as part of a larger enterprise system, resulting in often redundant APIs or shadow APIs that are not seen because they are obfuscated by apps.</li>
  <li><strong>One Partner</strong> - It is common to feel the need to respon to partner requests individual rather than seeing then as part of a larger system, resulting in repetitive work occurring, which when defined as a standardized set of partner resources would help speed up interactions.</li>
  <li><strong>One Integration</strong> - Integrations between two internal or external systems provides another common way in which similar business needs end up with one-off solutions that contributes to an ad hoc landscape rather than a ready to go integration toolbox for all business needs.</li>
  <li><strong>One Customer</strong> - Some customers are louder than others and may enjoy an outsized role in road map decisions, resulting in APIs that do not serve the wider needs of a customer base, resulting in more overhead when it comes to supporting an ad hoc API business landscape.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the moment each potential distraction might seem like a priority, however with the gravity of a centralized API strategy and a well-known API lifecycle and governance strategy, they can collectively be harnessed as part of the wider enterprise motion, resulting in less distractions along the way.</p>
