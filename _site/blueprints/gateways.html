<main class="flex-shrink-0"><h1 id="gateways">Gateways</h1>
<p>The first wave of API Gateways, historically, was offered as a component within larger API Management platforms. As the industry evolved, a new wave of API Gateways was introduced to provide solutions to a changing landscape. Some of these gateway providers are now supplementing their standalone offering with additional tools, often centered around a management approach more conducive to internal API lifecycles.</p>

<h2 id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>Depending on the gateway solution chosen, there is a mix of common capabilities offered at this essential, but also ubiquitous part of doing APIs today.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong> - Ensuring that consumers are authenticated before they access an API resource or capability, helping provide security across all APIs being used behind applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Authorization</strong> - Ensuring that once a consumer gains access to an API, that they only have access to resources and capabilities that they are entitled to have access to.</li>
  <li><strong>Plans</strong> - Organizing APIs and their consumers into standardized, but also sometimes customized access plans that govern which APIs they can use and how much of a resource they can have.</li>
  <li><strong>Routing</strong> - A common capability for gateways is to route traffic to a specific backend service, or possibly an external service, playing traffic cop when it comes to all the API requests made.</li>
  <li><strong>Policies</strong> - Applying machine readable policies that define the configuration and constraints applied to APIs and their consumers as they access digital resources via each gateway.</li>
  <li><strong>Rate Limiting</strong> - Placing limits on the number of requests consumers can make in a second, minute, hour, week, or month, ensuring that the availability of services isn’t abused.</li>
  <li><strong>Transformation</strong> - It is common for API gateways to transform requests being made, changing or adding headers, parameters, or the body of each request to support back-end needs.</li>
  <li><strong>Contracts</strong> - Gateways are increasingly using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and other contracts to shape the deployment and management of APis, leveraging the contract to operate.</li>
  <li><strong>Versioning</strong> - Helping API producers manage change across their AIs is increasingly supported at the gateway level, helping define access across many different versions of an API over time.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="characteristics">Characteristics</h2>
<p>The age of a single gateway from a single vendor controlling access to internal resources and capabilities is over, and today’s multi-gateway landscape possesses a range of characteristics.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Centralized</strong> - In many enterprises there can be a single centralized gateway, often times handline all of the traffic coming from outside the enterprise via a single entry point.</li>
  <li><strong>Federated</strong> - It is increasingly common for enterprise operations to support a federated gateway approach to making APIs available across domains, acquisitions, and potentially regions.</li>
  <li><strong>Regional</strong> - The deployment of regionally specific gateways has emerged to respond to the increased regulation and data sovereignty that has emerged within specific countries.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendors</strong> - It is common for enterprise organizations to have API gateways from multiple vendors, providing a mix of gateway solutions for teams to use when securing APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>Open</strong> - The usage of openl licensed gateways, as well as openly licensed contracts, policies, and other artifacts is an increasingly common hallmark of the gateway in operation.</li>
</ul>
