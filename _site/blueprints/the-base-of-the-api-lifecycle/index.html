Depending on your priorities and your entry point, you may need to expand or remove from this base lifecycle to match your desired situation.</p>

         <p>The API lifecycle will mean many different things depending on who you are talking to. This base API lifecycle isnâ€™t meant to be a lifecycle definition that matches the needs of every enterprise organization, but is intended to provide you with a base example to help you begin thinking about what your own API lifecycle is. The blueprint is designed to provide you a base that you can add to or remove from, iterating upon until you find a common definition of the API lifecycle that works for your organization.</p>

provides a common vocabulary for describing the surface area of request and response APIs, as well as webhooks, ensuring that API producers and consumers are on the same page when it comes to integration, but also helps stabilize multiple areas of the API lifecycle providing a contract that can be used for delivering documentation, mocks, testing, and more. </li>

Monitor</a> -  Monitors can be setup for all API contract testing, scheduling the run of contract testing when needed and configuring to run from the regions that matter most to business operations, making sure that each individual API contract is never breaking with consumers, making sure that each API is delivering as expected on a 24/7 schedule.  </li>
