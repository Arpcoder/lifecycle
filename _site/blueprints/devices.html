<main class="flex-shrink-0"><h1 id="devices-in-our-physical-world">Devices in our Physical World</h1>
<p>Once it was discovered that simple low-cost web APIs would work for low-latency mobile applications, developers began using the same approaches to sending messages and data between common everyday objects. Connecting devices across our personal and professional lives together, and bringing the online world into the physical world, helping automate and optimize how we do business.</p>

<h2 id="internet-of-things">Internet of Things</h2>
<p>Cameras, sensors, drones, and other types of Internet-connected devices are being applied across a range of industries, introducing “smart” capabilities into existing real-world processes, and leveraging APIs to send and receive data from the cloud. Tapping into the recent use of APIs makes cloud infrastructure available, and many of the APIs are being used by our iPhone and Android mobile applications, but are now used to power everyday objects.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Manufacturing</strong> - In the manufacturing industry, the industrial Internet of things (IIoT) allows for improvements in efficiency, cost, and safety. Networked sensors can be attached to physical equipment and assets. These sensors gather data so that operators can perform condition monitoring and measure overall equipment effectiveness. With the information provided by the sensors, operators can monitor machine temperature, vibrations, and sound frequencies, and they can use this data to perform predictive maintenance on equipment that gives abnormal readings. Predictive maintenance gives operators the opportunity to detect and repair problems before the equipment fails. Operators can also monitor machine run time, operating speed, and product output, which allows them to measure and improve production efficiency. IIoT sensors can also be used for supply chain improvements, such as locating inventory and controlling environmental conditions during storage and transport. Workers can use wearable technology to monitor their heart rate, skin temperature, and location to prevent overexertion, falls, and other safety threats.</li>
  <li><strong>Transportation</strong> - The transportation industry uses Internet-connected devices to increase traveler safety, reduce traffic congestion, and improve performance and infrastructure. For example, to increase railroad passenger safety, cameras and sensors can monitor factors like road temperature, train speed, traffic, and mechanical parts to look for anomalies, and trains can use intelligent cruise control to adapt speeds to current conditions. Dynamic road signs can alert drivers to lane closures, upcoming toll charges, and accidents. Autonomous vehicles also contain networked sensors, cameras, and communication systems, which provide the driver with real-time data about everything else that’s happening on the road. These autonomous vehicles can also communicate with each other about road conditions, traffic, and closures, and they can use this data to provide dynamic navigation instructions. Similar to other IoT-connected machinery, networked sensors allow operators to perform predictive maintenance on vehicles, which reduces operating costs. IoT devices can monitor roadways to analyze traffic patterns, fuel usage, and accidents in order to reduce congestion, and this data can be used to make decisions about traffic signals and resource scaling. To improve mass transit performance, sensors can monitor and analyze physical infrastructure to identify areas that need improvement, which can reduce operating costs and increase rider capacity.</li>
  <li><strong>Energy</strong> - The energy industry can use Internet-connected sensors, controllers, and meters to measure and analyze public utility consumption, and then use this data to make improvements to energy assets and processes. For example, billions of cubic meters of water are wasted each year due to leaks and mechanical failures. Using smart meters to track water pressure and flow lets utility workers find leaks and fix them immediately, and some of the fixes can be automated. Operators can also run analytics on electrical assets, such as cables, utility poles, and transformers, to track their past and present performance and then make predictions about future performance. Smart grids make it possible to track how much energy is being used in real time, which lets cities distribute power based on how much is actually needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Retail</strong> - In the retail industry, Internet-connected devices can be used to manage inventory throughout the supply chain and inform store managers about customers’ in-store experience. Drones and robots can monitor inventory both in storage warehouses as well as in-store shelves. GPS and RFID sensors can monitor assets, such as shopping carts, to reduce theft and lower costs. Smart shelving systems also use RFID tags. With smart shelving, an RFID tag sends data over antenna to an RFID reader, recording how many items are in stock and which ones people buy the most. Sensors can also generate heat maps within stores to identify where shoppers spend the most time, which helps store managers optimize the store’s layout. Stores can also use beacons that communicate with shoppers’ mobile phones. Beacons help stores identify patterns by gathering information about shoppers, such as the time of day they went to the store, the amount of time they spent in the checkout line, and which areas of the store they visited. Mobile phone apps also use geofencing to send alerts and personalized discounts to shoppers when they are near the store.</li>
  <li><strong>Cities</strong> - Smart cities use Internet-connected sensors, lights, and meters to improve public transit, safety, waste management, and energy use. City buses can use GPS and GSM to share real-time location information, making it easier for passengers to plan their travel. Pavement sensors can tell city planners how busy the roads are, and then use this information to dynamically change the timing of traffic lights. Video surveillance cameras can use automatic license plate recognition to collect tolls and help law enforcement locate stolen vehicles. IoT sensors can also help waste management companies by tracking how full trucks are so that they can plan more efficient waste pickup routes through the city. When a city uses smart grids, people can use home energy storage units, such as batteries charged by solar panels. During peak energy consumption hours, people can use energy from the battery, which places less stress on the city’s electrical grid.</li>
  <li><strong>Healthcare</strong> - In the healthcare industry, Internet-connected devices offer improvements that benefit patients, healthcare providers, hospitals, and health insurance providers. IoT devices such as wearable fitness bands, blood pressure cuffs, heart rate monitors, glucometers, and inhalers make it easier for people to manage chronic health conditions like asthma or diabetes. Physicians can use the data that is gathered by patients’ devices to monitor symptoms remotely and make proactive treatment plans. In an operating room, robots can assist with procedures that require extreme precision, and students can observe surgeries remotely using augmented reality. Hospitals can use sensors to track the location of medical equipment such as wheelchairs, nebulizers, or defibrillators within the facility. Health insurance companies can use data from wearable sensors to make underwriting decisions and detect fraudulent claims.</li>
  <li><strong>Supply Chain</strong> - Internet-connected devices offer improvements to supply chain management. IoT sensors can monitor the temperature, humidity, and light exposure of raw materials and their storage containers to make sure they are being stored in the best conditions. Sensors can also track the location of goods, allowing them to be located at any time, whether in storage or transit. Location information can be used to detect delays in transit, giving suppliers the option to find alternate routes. Suppliers can also use tracking information to confirm when goods arrive at their destination, which they can then use to trigger payments and invoices. The information provided by IoT devices can help prevent bottlenecks for critical supply chains like pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and essential minerals.</li>
  <li><strong>Agriculture</strong> - In the agriculture industry, IoT devices can gather data that helps farmers work more efficiently by monitoring crops and livestock, automating labor, and reducing waste. Farmers can use sensors or drones to monitor crop fields, allowing them to gather data about conditions such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pests, and overall crop health. Sensors can also monitor livestock and track both their location and health. Farmers can use this data to make their farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable. For example, when a sensor detects that soil moisture is low, it can trigger automatic irrigation. Drones can also perform tasks like planting crops and eliminating pests, which previously required human labor. To reduce waste, sensors can analyze metrics like the quantity of fertilizer being used, farm vehicle usage, and water and electricity consumption. Farmers can use this data to optimize their use of resources, preventing problems like overwatering.</li>

<p>APIs provide data to Internet-connected objects and gather data from those objects for use in desktop, web, and mobile applications. APIs are how every business sector is being reshaped as part of an ongoing digital transformation that every enterprise organization is facing today. Low-cost web infrastructure used to power more efficient and reliable APIs is how the Internet-connected landscape of the future will be defined.</p>
