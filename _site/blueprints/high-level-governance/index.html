         <p>A standardized API lifecycle can be applied to the design, development, and usage of API business workflows that are defined as machine readable collections which can be automated using monitors and CI/CD pipelines. Postman collections provide a versatile approach to defining multiple individual API requests that include authentication, parameters, headers, and other details, then organize into folders and specific sequences. Providing a format for defining, documenting, but then also executing common business workflows across many internal, partner, or external APIs. Something becomes endlessly useful when managed as part of a well defined lifecycle, equipping developers with what they need to define and design the workflows, but also maintain them, execute them, and use them to automate a variety of business tasks that exist in their worlds.</p>

            <p>API governance needs to be well defined, beginning with defining the overall API lifecycle, which this project is dedicated to doing, and the establishment of a formal strategy. Without properly defining of what governance is, and how it will be applied across the API lifecycle, it will never be realized. To establish API governance at the highest levels within an organization you need a well defined view of what is happening today across operations, and coherent articulation of where we should be going. This definition will not every e complete, but more of an ongoing journey for an organization to define itself.</p>

It takes a clear and articulate definition of how the API lifecycle is put into motion across teams to be able to reach a point where you can measure, guide, enforce, and evolve how APIs move across a well defined API lifecycle in any consistent way. - </li>

            <p>The structure and leadership of governance will need to be established for API governance to move forward at the highest levels, otherwise it will just be a low-level vision that a handful of teams are able to realize. The organization of governance needs to reflect the organization where it is being applied in order to have greatest impact. To do this, you have to invest resources, time, and people to helping organize, lead, and guide teams in learning about, understanding, applying, reporting, and providing feedback on what is working and what is not working when it comes to governance.</p>

            <p>API governance rules codifies what API governance is as it is applied as part of the design, development and build process on the ground floor of API operations. Rules provide the benchmark for what governance is across teams, and provide an artifact that can be applied across the API lifecycle by individual designers and developers, and eventually baked into the pipelines that move API infrastructure forward. Rules should reflect what is happening on the ground today, but apply enforcement as part of a forward motion, acknowledging that legacy APIs may not always rise to the level governance an organization is moving towards.</p>

            <p>Reporting on the realities and outcomes of API governance across the API lifecycle is needed to make it more visual and tangible for everyone involved. Reporting across governance being applied to individual APIs, groups of APIs, and overall operations can be realized as part of native platform reporting, customized, localized or in aggregate with Postman Visualizer, or made seamless with existing operations by piping data into APM and other systems to make available for reporting and visualizations via dashboards.</p>

         <p>This blueprint looks at how you can approach API governance as an organization, establishing high level strategy and practices that can be used to direct governance efforts across teams. Each element within this blueprint works to provide a simple overview of what is involved across the entire life of an API, with more detail present on the detail page for each element (if you are viewing this on the API lifecycle project site). If you are reading this via a PDF or printed version you can visit the landing page for this blueprint to access more information and view specific actions you might possibly consider taking as part of applying each element of this proposed lifecycle within your own operations. This blueprint is a living document and will continue to evolve and be added to over time based upon feedback from readers. If you have any questions, feedback, or feel like there is more information you need, feel free to jump on the Github discussion for this blueprint, or any of the individual elements present--the value this blueprint provides is actively defined by the feedback community members like you.</p>
