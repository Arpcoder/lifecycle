provides a common vocabulary for describing the surface area of request and response APIs, as well as webhooks, ensuring that API producers and consumers are on the same page when it comes to integration, but also helps stabilize multiple areas of the API lifecycle providing a contract that can be used for delivering documentation, mocks, testing, and more. </li>

Prototyping an API using a Postman collection provides a quick and intuitive way to articulate what an API should do in a way that can be documented, mocked, and shared with other team members and consumers, offering an alterative approach to the API design first methodology which can push the need for an OpenAPI artifact further downstream in the process, but achieving similar outcomes. </li>

            <p>Mocking how an API works and behaves provides an effective way for teams to collaborate, communicate, and iterate as part of the design of an API, but also is something that can be used as part of testing, or just providing a sandbox environment for API consumers to learn before they actually begin working with any API in production.</p>

Performance tests can be defined as individual tests using collections, pulling from one or many individual API paths and measuring the time it takes for the response to be sent, providing a test that can be run manually, scheduled across multiple geographic regions, or executed as part of a CI/CD pipeline, helping ensure an API is always meeting it's expected performance benchmarks. </li>

Security tests can be defined for any API using executable and shareable collections, testing for common OWASP vulnerabilities, as well as other more custom scenarios or business approaches, providing a single or suite of security tests that can be manually run, schedule across multiple regions, or executed as part of a CI/CD pipeline, automating security consistently across APIs. </li>

Integration tests can be defined for any API using executable and shareable collections, testing integrations, as well as other more custom scenarios or business approaches, providing a single or

            <p>Establishing a well defined process for deploy an API helps teams deploy new APIs, as well as each future iteration of an API in a consistent and repeatable way, making sure APIs are deployed using known development, staging, production, other agreed upon stages that actively put to work the other elements like documentation, testing, while contributing to observability.</p>

            <p>APIs should be managed using a set of common, well-defined policies that define and govern how APIs are access via all stages of the lifecycle, and ensure that every API has relevant authentication, rate limits, logging, and other essential aspects of managing APIs at scale, helping strike a balance between making APIs accessible and the privacy and security concerns that exist.</p>

            <p>All tests applied to an API should be monitored on a logical schedule and from relevant geographic regions, monitoring that APIs aren't breaking their contract, falling below their agreed upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible.</p>

Monitor</a> -  Monitors can be setup for all API security testing, scheduling the run of security tests when needed, making sure that each individual API is regularly certified as being secured, ensuring that APIs do not become a liability due to changes, but also keeping all APIs compliant with the latest level of security testing that is occurring across an entire organization. </li>

            <p>The ability to discover APIs at all stages of the API lifecycle is key to reduce redundancy across operations, helping teams find existing APIs before they develop new ones, and properly match API consumers with the right APIs, supporting documentation, relevant workflows, and the feedback loops that exist as part of the operation of APIs internally within the enterprise, or externally with 3rd party developers.</p>

networks allow for teams, APIs, collections, and other elements to be made available for searching and browsing by a public audience, helping API producers reach a larger audience, but also allowing consumers to quickly find the APIs and other resources they need in their applications and integrations, networking consumers with producers in an ongoing and collaborative way. </li>

            <p>Having a plan for the eventual retirement and ultimate deprecation of an API, or for specific paths or versions of an API should be a part of every API lifecycle, even when there is no plan for deprecation there should be a process in place for setting expectations for how long an API will be supported, as well as formal process to follow once retirement comes into view on the horizon.</p>
