<main class="flex-shrink-0"><h1 id="platform">Platform</h1>
<p>API Platforms are software systems with integrated tools and processes that allow producers and consumers to effectively build, manage, publish, and consume APIs. Leveraging existing infrastructure, as well as an ever-expanding and changing mix of API-driven services to define, shape, and operate a platform to sustain business in a digital marketplace.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Integrated</strong> - API platform are seamlessly integrated with your existing operations, taking the source control and CI/CD used as part of the existing software development lifecycle, marrying it to your gateway, and APM solutions–equipping your teams with a modern API lifecycle that is bolted to your existing investment in on-premise and cloud infrastructure over the couple of decades.</li>
  <li><strong>Discoverable</strong> - Search and discover of APIs and the operations around them is the natural state. Teams are relied on to always publish their artifacts and supporting metadata, with workspaces and repositories indexed and made available as a defaut part of regular operations. Enabling infrastructure to keep pace with business, and teams to just focus on the work that moves business forward, not just busy work.</li>
  <li><strong>Collaborative</strong> - An API platform brings teams and APIs out of the shadows, lowering the walls between business and IT groups, while making both the producer and consumer side of the API lifecycle a collaborative affair. Making it so that every aspect of a modern API lifecycle is modular, portable, sharable, but also executable, helping support more stakeholders across API operations, attracing much needed business expertise to help bring APIs in alignment with meaningful business outcomes.</li>
  <li><strong>Observable</strong> - API platforms allow for any output across API operations to be gathered, measured, and made available via visual dashboards and reporting, helping make very abstract APIs more tangible and associated to business outcomes. Bringing the awareness necessary to understand the overall state of enterprise operations, and begin making the changes needed to actually steer the direction a business is going, which eventually begins to translate into a more agile and nimbe enterprise operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Automated</strong> - API platforms deliver APIs, but they are also defined by APIs, making every part of the API lifecycle across all of API operations automatable. Allowing APIs and the infrastructure behind them automated using workflows that are scheduled and executed from one or more cloud regions, via CI/CD pipelines, and responding to the most critical or even mundane events that happen daily at scale across operations. Providing enterprise teams with the resources they need to mee the future demand of their industries with smaller teams.</li>
  <li><strong>Governed</strong> - Platform bolt API operations onto our existing organizational infrastructure via standards like SSO and SCIM, but allow us to “see” all of our APIs so that we can ensure they are reliable, secure, and consistent in how they power our digital resources and capabilities. An API platform grounds not just the design of our APIs, but also how we document, test, deploy, distribute, and observe our APIs, elevating what we know as governance beyond just the naming and ordering of our APIs, to platform level control over the entire life of hundreds or thousands of APIs.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the last decade we’ve moved from using tens or hundreds of APIs, to using thousands of APIs to make our busines operate. In the next decade this will move from thousands to hundreds of thousands, which something that can only be achieved with an industrial-grade API platform to carry the load.</p>
