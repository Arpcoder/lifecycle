API-first companies fully understand that APIs are not just isolated technical concepts, and they define how your business operates online today, and are what will define your digital transformation for many years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n      </center>\n\n      <!-- Show Video-->\n\n    \n\n\n<!-- Show Video-->    \n      \n      \n     \n  \n      \n      <!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n     \n\n<!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n      <br>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n   <div class=\"row blurb text-center\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n         <h2>Return to Main Page</h2>\n         <p class=\"collection__end_p\">This provides a link back to the home page if you need it.\n         </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-12 blurb_padding\"><a class=\"btn btn__secondary-light\" href=\"http://localhost:4000\">Return to Main Page</a></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n\n               </main>\n\n               <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n      </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n","previous":{"collection":"answers","path":"_answers/what-is-a-successful-workspace.md","url":"/answers/what-is-a-successful-workspace/","id":"/answers/what-is-a-successful-workspace","relative_path":"_answers/what-is-a-successful-workspace.md","draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"answers","name":"What is a successful workspace?","description":"While your focus is influenced by your personal objectives and target community, there are some familiar measures of a “healthy” workspace.","title":"What Is A Successful Workspace","slug":"what-is-a-successful-workspace","ext":".md","tags":[],"date":"2021-11-28 17:07:32 -0800"},"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"answers","name":"What is an API-first company?","description":"API-first embrace a model of software development in which applications are conceptualized and built as an interconnection of internal and external services through APIs.","title":"What Is An Api First Company","slug":"what-is-an-api-first-company","ext":".md","tags":[],"date":"2021-11-28 17:07:32 -0800"},"content":"<p>While your focus is influenced by your personal objectives and target community, there are some familiar measures of a “healthy” workspace.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Count of active forks of a collection or environment</li>\n  <li>Count of people watching your API or collection for updates</li>\n  <li>Recent workspace activity to demonstrate resources are actively updated</li>\n  <li>History of mock server call logs</li>\n  <li>Percent of API calls hitting your server that includes a Postman (or custom) User-Agent header</li>\n</ul>\n","output":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\" data-react-helmet=\"lang\">\n   <head>\n\n      <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Providing the most flexibility when it comes to authoring an OpenAPI across teams.</p>\n\n\n      </div>\n      </center>\n\n      <!-- Show Video-->\n\n\n<!-- Show Video-->    \n      \n      \n     \n  \n      \n      <!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n     \n           \n<h2>Related Links</h2>\n<ul>\n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://openapis.org/\" target==\"_blank\">OpenAPI</a></li>\n        \n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://www.asyncapi.com/\" target==\"_blank\">AsyncAPI</a></li>\n        \n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\" target==\"_blank\">JSON Schema</a></li>\n        \n       \n</ul>    \n<hr> \n\n<!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n      <br>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n   <div class=\"row blurb text-center\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n         <h2>Return to Main Page</h2>\n         <p class=\"collection__end_p\">This provides a link back to the home page if you need it.\n         </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-12 blurb_padding\"><a class=\"btn btn__secondary-light\" href=\"http://localhost:4000\">Return to Main Page</a></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n\n               </main>\n\n               <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n      </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n","previous":{"collection":"answers","path":"_answers/how-do-you-become-an-api-first-company.md","url":"/answers/how-do-you-become-an-api-first-company/","id":"/answers/how-do-you-become-an-api-first-company","excerpt":"<p>Becoming API-first begins with planning and taking small incremental steps to define, standardize, and perpetually optimize how you deliver and operate your applications and integrations using APIs.

Providing a list of platform capabilities that can be mapped to enterprise organizations to get a handle on the productivity, quality, and overall governance of their operations.</p>\n\n\n      </div>\n      </center>\n\n      <!-- Show Video-->\n\n    \n\n\n<!-- Show Video-->    \n      \n      \n     \n  \n      \n      <!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n     \n\n<!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n      <br>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n   <div class=\"row blurb text-center\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n         <h2>Return to Main Page</h2>\n         <p class=\"collection__end_p\">This provides a link back to the home page if you need it.\n         </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-12 blurb_padding\"><a class=\"btn btn__secondary-light\" href=\"http://localhost:4000\">Return to Main Page</a></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n\n               </main>\n\n               <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n      </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n","previous":{"collection":"answers","path":"_answers/what-is-an-api-first-company.md","url":"/answers/what-is-an-api-first-company/","id":"/answers/what-is-an-api-first-company","relative_path":"_answers/what-is-an-api-first-company.md","draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"answers","name":"What is an API-first company?","description":"API-first embrace a model of software development in which applications are conceptualized and built as an interconnection of internal and external services through APIs.","title":"What Is An Api First Company","slug":"what-is-an-api-first-company","ext":".md","tags":[],"date":"2021-11-28 17:07:32 -0800"},"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"answers","name":"What is the timeline for Postman’s journey to becoming an API platform?","description":"As an API solution, Postman has been evolving for over seven years, beginning as a simple API client, but then growing into a full fledge API platform that services the entire API lifecycle.","title":"What Is The Timeline For Postmans Journey To Becoming An Api Platform","slug":"what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform","ext":".md","tags":[],"date":"2021-11-28 17:07:32 -0800"},"content":"<p>API-first companies understand that learning to deliver applications using a mix of internal and external services using APIs is an essential part of their digital transformation.

These API specifications are used by top API providers like eBay, Salesforce, Github, Twitter, and others to describe their APIs so that they can document, mock, test, and generate code across their API operations.</p>\n\n\n      </div>\n      </center>\n\n      <!-- Show Video-->\n\n\n    <hr>\n    <center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XX9QeeQTNPE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n    <hr>\n    \n\n<!-- Show Video-->    \n      \n      \n     \n  \n      \n      <!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n     \n           \n<h2>Related Links</h2>\n<ul>\n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://openapis.org/\" target==\"_blank\">OpenAPI</a></li>\n        \n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://www.asyncapi.com/\" target==\"_blank\">AsyncAPI</a></li>\n        \n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\" target==\"_blank\">JSON Schema</a></li>\n        \n       \n</ul>    \n<hr> \n\n<!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n      <br>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n   <div class=\"row blurb text-center\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n         <h2>Return to Main Page</h2>\n         <p class=\"collection__end_p\">This provides a link back to the home page if you need it.\n         </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-12 blurb_padding\"><a class=\"btn btn__secondary-light\" href=\"http://localhost:4000\">Return to Main Page</a></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n\n               </main>\n\n               <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n      </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n","previous":{"collection":"answers","path":"_answers/what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform.md","url":"/answers/what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform/","id":"/answers/what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform","relative_path":"_answers/what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform.md","draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"answers","name":"What is the timeline for Postman’s journey to becoming an API platform?","description":"As an API solution, Postman has been evolving for over seven years, beginning as a simple API client, but then growing into a full fledge API platform that services the entire API lifecycle.","title":"What Is The Timeline For Postmans Journey To Becoming An Api Platform","slug":"what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform","ext":".md","tags":[],"date":"2021-11-28 17:07:32 -0800"},"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"answers","name":"Why Should We Use API Specifications?","description":"API specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema provide us with a shared vocabulary for describing the surface area of our APIs in exact and machine-readable ways.","links":[{"title":"OpenAPI","url":"https://openapis.org/"},{"title":"AsyncAPI","url":"https://www.asyncapi.com/"},{"title":"JSON Schema","url":"https://json-schema.org/"}],"video":"<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XX9QeeQTNPE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>","title":"Why Should We Use Api Specifications","slug":"why-should-we-use-api-specifications","ext":".md","tags":[],"date":"2021-11-28 17:07:32 -0800"},"content":"<p>A common question we hear often is about what the Postman story is, and how we have evolved to become an API platform that supports the entire API lifecycle. Postman began as a simple API client and debugging tool, which quickly grew into a very adaptable API testing solution, but then has rapidly expanded to meet many other needs of our customers across the API lifecycle. While there are plenty of other capabilities that Postman has brought over the years, this timeline shows the core progression of Postman from a client into an API platform, which provides a reflection of many of our customer’s own journeys.</p>\n\n<p>It all began with providing a simple API client to make developers’ lives easier:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>2013 - Client, Scripts, and Testing</strong> - Life began as a browser bases solution for testing and debugging APIs, helping developers understand how APIs work or do not work, then saving that understanding as a reusable, sharable collection that can be run by others.</li>\n  <li><strong>2014 - Runner and CLI Runner</strong> - Collections become a standardized way to define, save, and then run one or many API requests that includes scripting for automation, allowing collections to be run on the desktop or via a command-line interface and CI/CD.</li>\n  <li><strong>2015 - Documentation &amp; Code Generation</strong> - Documentation emerges as a priority, expanding the ability for developers to publish shareable and embeddable documentation that also has a variety of code snippets in different programming languages.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - Github &amp; GitLab Integration</strong> - Source control integration for developers becomes important, allowing Postman to be more tightly linked to the developer’s existing software development lifecycle, allowing artifacts and tests to be kept in alignment with source control.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - APM, Messaging Integration</strong> - Following source control, the need to integrate with existing APM, notification, and messaging systems became an important part of developers’ workflow to produce and consume APIs as part of their work.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - Monitoring</strong> - Being able to schedule the monitoring of collection and extend the automation introduced by runners, and at the command line and CI/CD pipeline level, allowing contracts, performance, integration, and other tests to be monitored.</li>\n  <li><strong>2017 - Mocking </strong> - Mocking is an essential part of the API lifecycle, and as part of testing, so Postman introduced the ability to deploy mock servers as defined by a collection and the examples it contains providing a simple way to create static mocks of APIs.</li>\n  <li><strong>2018 - Team Workspaces, Comments, and Search</strong> - Acknowledging the need for closer collaboration across teams, workspaces were launched, as well as the ability to comment on collections, and search across workspaces, APIs, and collections.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Builder</strong> - With the increased usage of Postman to not just consume and test APIs, but also to deliver APIs, the API Builder was launched, allowing APIs to be designed and developed using OpenAPI, RAML, and GraphQL across team workspaces.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Interceptor</strong> - To support the reverse engineering of the existing APIs that exist behind web applications Postman interceptor was launched, allowing web traffic in Chrome to be captured and then used to define a Postman collection within a workspace.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Public Network</strong> - The public API network was launched to support the needs of public API producers needing to attract new users, but then also provide a public catalog for API consumers to use when looking for APIs to use in their applications.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Reporting</strong> - Reporting was launched to support the needs of the enterprise, providing a way for leadership to see activity across teams, workspaces, and APIs, helping understand activity and move towards more governance of API operations.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Private Network</strong> - The private API network was launched to support the need for enterprise organizations to have a single internal catalog where teams can publish and discover the APIs and microservices that are being developed across teams and workspaces.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Public Workspaces</strong> - The ability to change the visibility of a workspace to be publicly available was introduced to support the needs of API producers when it comes to engaging with consumers, allowing them to view, fork, and engage with their APIs.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Websockets</strong> - With the introduction of WebSockets, the platform signaled a migration towards being a multi-protocol API platform, supporting WebSockets, and socket.io, but laying the groundwork for gRPC, and support for other protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This timeline represents the journey of Postman from a browser extension to a desktop application then ultimately an API platform by listening to, and then supporting the needs of API consumers, but then also API producers. Providing what teams are needing when it comes to designing, developing, and operating their APIs, but also consuming and automating using private, partner, and public APIs.</p>\n\n<p> This represents just a subset of the platform capabilities but reflects the Postman journey to become an API platform that will support the needs of the enterprise into the future.

API-first companies fully understand that APIs are not just isolated technical concepts, and they define how your business operates online today, and are what will define your digital transformation for many years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n      </div>\n      </center>\n\n      <!-- Show Video-->\n\n    \n\n\n<!-- Show Video-->    \n      \n      \n     \n  \n      \n      <!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n     \n\n<!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n      <br>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n   <div class=\"row blurb text-center\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n         <h2>Return to Main Page</h2>\n         <p class=\"collection__end_p\">This provides a link back to the home page if you need it.\n         </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-12 blurb_padding\"><a class=\"btn btn__secondary-light\" href=\"http://localhost:4000\">Return to Main Page</a></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n\n               </main>\n\n               <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n      </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n","previous":{"collection":"answers","path":"_answers/what-is-a-successful-workspace.md","url":"/answers/what-is-a-successful-workspace/","id":"/answers/what-is-a-successful-workspace","relative_path":"_answers/what-is-a-successful-workspace.md","draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"answers","name":"What is a successful workspace?","description":"While your focus is influenced by your personal objectives and target community, there are some familiar measures of a “healthy” workspace.","title":"What Is A Successful Workspace","slug":"what-is-a-successful-workspace","ext":".md","tags":[],"date":"2021-11-28 17:07:32 -0800"},"draft":false,"categories":[],"layout":"answers","name":"What is an API-first company?","description":"API-first embrace a model of software development in which applications are conceptualized and built as an interconnection of internal and external services through APIs.","title":"What Is An Api First Company","slug":"what-is-an-api-first-company","ext":".md","tags":[],"date":"2021-11-28 17:07:32 -0800"},"content":"<p>While your focus is influenced by your personal objectives and target community, there are some familiar measures of a “healthy” workspace.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Count of active forks of a collection or environment</li>\n  <li>Count of people watching your API or collection for updates</li>\n  <li>Recent workspace activity to demonstrate resources are actively updated</li>\n  <li>History of mock server call logs</li>\n  <li>Percent of API calls hitting your server that includes a Postman (or custom) User-Agent header</li>\n</ul>\n","output":"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\" data-react-helmet=\"lang\">\n   <head>\n\n      <meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html;

Postman began as a simple API client and debugging tool, which quickly grew into a very adaptable API testing solution, but then has rapidly expanded to meet many other needs of our customers across the API lifecycle.

While there are plenty of other capabilities that Postman has brought over the years, this timeline shows the core progression of Postman from a client into an API platform, which provides a reflection of many of our customer’s own journeys.</p>\n\n<p>It all began with providing a simple API client to make developers’ lives easier:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>2013 - Client, Scripts, and Testing</strong> - Life began as a browser bases solution for testing and debugging APIs, helping developers understand how APIs work or do not work, then saving that understanding as a reusable, sharable collection that can be run by others.</li>\n  <li><strong>2014 - Runner and CLI Runner</strong> - Collections become a standardized way to define, save, and then run one or many API requests that includes scripting for automation, allowing collections to be run on the desktop or via a command-line interface and CI/CD.</li>\n  <li><strong>2015 - Documentation &amp; Code Generation</strong> - Documentation emerges as a priority, expanding the ability for developers to publish shareable and embeddable documentation that also has a variety of code snippets in different programming languages.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - Github &amp; GitLab Integration</strong> - Source control integration for developers becomes important, allowing Postman to be more tightly linked to the developer’s existing software development lifecycle, allowing artifacts and tests to be kept in alignment with source control.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - APM, Messaging Integration</strong> - Following source control, the need to integrate with existing APM, notification, and messaging systems became an important part of developers’ workflow to produce and consume APIs as part of their work.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - Monitoring</strong> - Being able to schedule the monitoring of collection and extend the automation introduced by runners, and at the command line and CI/CD pipeline level, allowing contracts, performance, integration, and other tests to be monitored.</li>\n  <li><strong>2017 - Mocking </strong> - Mocking is an essential part of the API lifecycle, and as part of testing, so Postman introduced the ability to deploy mock servers as defined by a collection and the examples it contains providing a simple way to create static mocks of APIs.</li>\n  <li><strong>2018 - Team Workspaces, Comments, and Search</strong> - Acknowledging the need for closer collaboration across teams, workspaces were launched, as well as the ability to comment on collections, and search across workspaces, APIs, and collections.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Builder</strong> - With the increased usage of Postman to not just consume and test APIs, but also to deliver APIs, the API Builder was launched, allowing APIs to be designed and developed using OpenAPI, RAML, and GraphQL across team workspaces.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Interceptor</strong> - To support the reverse engineering of the existing APIs that exist behind web applications Postman interceptor was launched, allowing web traffic in Chrome to be captured and then used to define a Postman collection within a workspace.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Public Network</strong> - The public API network was launched to support the needs of public API producers needing to attract new users, but then also provide a public catalog for API consumers to use when looking for APIs to use in their applications.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Reporting</strong> - Reporting was launched to support the needs of the enterprise, providing a way for leadership to see activity across teams, workspaces, and APIs, helping understand activity and move towards more governance of API operations.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Private Network</strong> - The private API network was launched to support the need for enterprise organizations to have a single internal catalog where teams can publish and discover the APIs and microservices that are being developed across teams and workspaces.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Public Workspaces</strong> - The ability to change the visibility of a workspace to be publicly available was introduced to support the needs of API producers when it comes to engaging with consumers, allowing them to view, fork, and engage with their APIs.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Websockets</strong> - With the introduction of WebSockets, the platform signaled a migration towards being a multi-protocol API platform, supporting WebSockets, and socket.io, but laying the groundwork for gRPC, and support for other protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This timeline represents the journey of Postman from a browser extension to a desktop application then ultimately an API platform by listening to, and then supporting the needs of API consumers, but then also API producers. Providing what teams are needing when it comes to designing, developing, and operating their APIs, but also consuming and automating using private, partner, and public APIs.</p>\n\n<p> This represents just a subset of the platform capabilities but reflects the Postman journey to become an API platform that will support the needs of the enterprise into the future. Providing a list of platform capabilities that can be mapped to enterprise organizations to get a handle on the productivity, quality, and overall governance of their operations.</p>\n\n\n      </div>\n      </center>\n\n      <!-- Show Video-->\n\n    \n\n\n<!-- Show Video-->    \n      \n      \n     \n  \n      \n      <!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n     \n\n<!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n      <br>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n   <div class=\"row blurb text-center\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n         <h2>Return to Main Page</h2>\n         <p class=\"collection__end_p\">This provides a link back to the home page if you need it.\n         </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-12 blurb_padding\"><a class=\"btn btn__secondary-light\" href=\"http://localhost:4000\">Return to Main Page</a></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n\n               </main>\n\n               <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n      </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n","previous":{"collection":"answers","path":"_answers/what-is-an-api-first-company.md","url":"/answers/what-is-an-api-first-company/","id":"/answers/what-is-an-api-first-company","excerpt":"<p>API-first companies understand that learning to deliver applications using a mix of internal and external services using APIs is an essential part of their digital transformation.

While there are plenty of other capabilities that Postman has brought over the years, this timeline shows the core progression of Postman from a client into an API platform, which provides a reflection of many of our customer’s own journeys.</p>\n\n<p>It all began with providing a simple API client to make developers’ lives easier:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>2013 - Client, Scripts, and Testing</strong> - Life began as a browser bases solution for testing and debugging APIs, helping developers understand how APIs work or do not work, then saving that understanding as a reusable, sharable collection that can be run by others.</li>\n  <li><strong>2014 - Runner and CLI Runner</strong> - Collections become a standardized way to define, save, and then run one or many API requests that includes scripting for automation, allowing collections to be run on the desktop or via a command-line interface and CI/CD.</li>\n  <li><strong>2015 - Documentation &amp; Code Generation</strong> - Documentation emerges as a priority, expanding the ability for developers to publish shareable and embeddable documentation that also has a variety of code snippets in different programming languages.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - Github &amp; GitLab Integration</strong> - Source control integration for developers becomes important, allowing Postman to be more tightly linked to the developer’s existing software development lifecycle, allowing artifacts and tests to be kept in alignment with source control.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - APM, Messaging Integration</strong> - Following source control, the need to integrate with existing APM, notification, and messaging systems became an important part of developers’ workflow to produce and consume APIs as part of their work.</li>\n  <li><strong>2016 - Monitoring</strong> - Being able to schedule the monitoring of collection and extend the automation introduced by runners, and at the command line and CI/CD pipeline level, allowing contracts, performance, integration, and other tests to be monitored.</li>\n  <li><strong>2017 - Mocking </strong> - Mocking is an essential part of the API lifecycle, and as part of testing, so Postman introduced the ability to deploy mock servers as defined by a collection and the examples it contains providing a simple way to create static mocks of APIs.</li>\n  <li><strong>2018 - Team Workspaces, Comments, and Search</strong> - Acknowledging the need for closer collaboration across teams, workspaces were launched, as well as the ability to comment on collections, and search across workspaces, APIs, and collections.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Builder</strong> - With the increased usage of Postman to not just consume and test APIs, but also to deliver APIs, the API Builder was launched, allowing APIs to be designed and developed using OpenAPI, RAML, and GraphQL across team workspaces.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Interceptor</strong> - To support the reverse engineering of the existing APIs that exist behind web applications Postman interceptor was launched, allowing web traffic in Chrome to be captured and then used to define a Postman collection within a workspace.</li>\n  <li><strong>2019 - Public Network</strong> - The public API network was launched to support the needs of public API producers needing to attract new users, but then also provide a public catalog for API consumers to use when looking for APIs to use in their applications.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Reporting</strong> - Reporting was launched to support the needs of the enterprise, providing a way for leadership to see activity across teams, workspaces, and APIs, helping understand activity and move towards more governance of API operations.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Private Network</strong> - The private API network was launched to support the need for enterprise organizations to have a single internal catalog where teams can publish and discover the APIs and microservices that are being developed across teams and workspaces.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Public Workspaces</strong> - The ability to change the visibility of a workspace to be publicly available was introduced to support the needs of API producers when it comes to engaging with consumers, allowing them to view, fork, and engage with their APIs.</li>\n  <li><strong>2020 - Websockets</strong> - With the introduction of WebSockets, the platform signaled a migration towards being a multi-protocol API platform, supporting WebSockets, and socket.io, but laying the groundwork for gRPC, and support for other protocols.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This timeline represents the journey of Postman from a browser extension to a desktop application then ultimately an API platform by listening to, and then supporting the needs of API consumers, but then also API producers. Providing what teams are needing when it comes to designing, developing, and operating their APIs, but also consuming and automating using private, partner, and public APIs.</p>\n\n<p> This represents just a subset of the platform capabilities but reflects the Postman journey to become an API platform that will support the needs of the enterprise into the future.

AsyncAPI does the same thing but focuses on the more asynchronous event and message-driven APIs, describing the channels and other details, while also using JSON Schema to describe the objects being published and subscribed to each channel. API specifications describe the surface area of our APIs so that we can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Document</strong> - Generate human readable HTML documentation for each API.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mock</strong> - Generate static mock servers that emulate what an API can do.</li>\n  <li><strong>Test</strong> - Generate contract, performance, and other types of API tests.</li>\n  <li><strong>Generate Code</strong> - Generate code in a variety of programming languages.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are just a handful of the most common reasons API providers use API specifications. However, in addition to these API lifecycle benefits, API specifications provide us with a standard, widely understood way to describe the surface area of our APIs in a way that other developers will understand.

OpenAPI allows us to describe the details of synchronous, request, and response APIs, using JSON Schema to define what should be submitted and what a user can expect back as a response. AsyncAPI does the same thing but focuses on the more asynchronous event and message-driven APIs, describing the channels and other details, while also using JSON Schema to describe the objects being published and subscribed to each channel. API specifications describe the surface area of our APIs so that we can:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Document</strong> - Generate human readable HTML documentation for each API.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mock</strong> - Generate static mock servers that emulate what an API can do.</li>\n  <li><strong>Test</strong> - Generate contract, performance, and other types of API tests.</li>\n  <li><strong>Generate Code</strong> - Generate code in a variety of programming languages.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are just a handful of the most common reasons API providers use API specifications. However, in addition to these API lifecycle benefits, API specifications provide us with a standard, widely understood way to describe the surface area of our APIs in a way that other developers will understand. API specifications help make how we communicate and collaborate around an API across the API lifecycle, helping increase team velocity when producing and consuming APIs. These API specifications are used by top API providers like eBay, Salesforce, Github, Twitter, and others to describe their APIs so that they can document, mock, test, and generate code across their API operations.</p>\n\n\n      </div>\n      </center>\n\n      <!-- Show Video-->\n\n\n    <hr>\n    <center><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XX9QeeQTNPE\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>\n    <hr>\n    \n\n<!-- Show Video-->    \n      \n      \n     \n  \n      \n      <!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n     \n           \n<h2>Related Links</h2>\n<ul>\n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://openapis.org/\" target==\"_blank\">OpenAPI</a></li>\n        \n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://www.asyncapi.com/\" target==\"_blank\">AsyncAPI</a></li>\n        \n    \n        \n            <li><a href=\"https://json-schema.org/\" target==\"_blank\">JSON Schema</a></li>\n        \n       \n</ul>    \n<hr> \n\n<!-- Show Related Links-->\n\n      <br>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"container-fluid\">\n   <div class=\"row blurb text-center\">\n      <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n         <h2>Return to Main Page</h2>\n         <p class=\"collection__end_p\">This provides a link back to the home page if you need it.\n         </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"col-md-12 blurb_padding\"><a class=\"btn btn__secondary-light\" href=\"http://localhost:4000\">Return to Main Page</a></div>\n   </div>\n</div>\n\n\n               </main>\n\n               <footer class=\"footer\"></footer>\n            </div>\n         </div>\n      </div>\n\n</body>\n</html>\n","previous":{"collection":"answers","path":"_answers/what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform.md","url":"/answers/what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform/","id":"/answers/what-is-the-timeline-for-postmans-journey-to-becoming-an-api-platform","excerpt":"<p>A common question we hear often is about what the Postman story is, and how we have evolved to become an API platform that supports the entire API lifecycle.

Providing what teams are needing when it comes to designing, developing, and operating their APIs, but also consuming and automating using private, partner, and public APIs.</p>\n\n<p> This represents just a subset of the platform capabilities but reflects the Postman journey to become an API platform that will support the needs of the enterprise into the future.
