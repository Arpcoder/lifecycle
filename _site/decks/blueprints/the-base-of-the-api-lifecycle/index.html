				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Discover</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Before starting a new API endeavor, it is crucial to discover if the solution to the problem you're trying to solve already exists. Building on already existing functionality brings products and services to market faster. Postman has several elements that make this discovery step easier.</p>

						<h3>Search</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Ensuring APIs are always available via search helps make sure that APIs can be found by consumers, but also by other producers who are looking to develop similar APIs, making search for APIs, as well as the operations around each API a critical aspect of the API lifecycle that should be considered as early on in the design and development of an API, but at least as it is deployed into production.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Design</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Designing an interface is one of the most critical steps in the API's lifecycle. It involves making decisions on how the interface will look and feel when used. American software engineer Grady Booch calls these decisions "significant", where significance is measured by the cost of change. Once your API has its first user, the cost of changing that interface increases significantly. Applying the appropriate rigor at this stage of the lifecycle will decrease the likelihood that change is necessary later. This includes, but is not limited to, defining performance, functionality, and security expectations.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Manage</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Markets, strategies, team experience, and professional expectations change. So too, do APIs. However, changing an interface is no trivial task, given the number of integrations depending on it. Learning to prioritize and schedule changes to minimize the negative impacts is a skill. Thankfully, Postman includes elements to navigate through this step of growing importance.</p>

						<h3>Deprecate</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">API deprecation occurs eventually for all APIs, and having a formal process to the deprecation of APIs or specific versions of an API helps API producers prepare for this inevitable future in a way that keeps consumers properly informed about what is happening, allowing the deprecation of APIs to happen consistently across all teams, groups, and the entire enterprise organization.</p>
