						<h3>Reference Documentation</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">It is helpful for API consumers to have complete documentation for the entire surface area of an API, providing a complete reference of what is possible with an API to help consumers explore every path, parameter, schema, and other details of how an API works, making the resources and capabilities available within API something consumers can find and put to use without much work.</p>

						<h3>CI/CD Pipeline</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Like other aspects of the software development lifecycle, APIs benefit from well defined, repeatable CI/CD pipelines to deploy, test, automate, and orchestrate throughout the API lifecycle, publishing APIs to development, staging, production, and other stages, but then also ensuring other elements like publishing of documentation, and tests are baked into the process.</p>

						<h3>Contract Testing</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Contract tests can be derived from API artifacts like OpenAPI, JSON Schema, and GraphQL, and used to ensure there are no changes to what has been promised when an API was designed or developed, providing a repeatable test that can be run manually, on a schedule from multiple regions, or as part of a CI/CD pipeline to ensure contracts with consumers are upheld.</p>
