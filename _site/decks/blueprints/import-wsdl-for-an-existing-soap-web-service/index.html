				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Define</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">For traditional web services the web services description language (WSDL) is the key to defining and understanding what each API is capable of. Similar to an OpenAPI, the WSDL describes the surface area of a SOAP web service, defining the available methods and payload structure. Upon import or creation of a new API using WSDL, a modern API lifecycle can be set into motion through the generation of collections for documenting and testing of web services. Helping modernize existing web services by applying some of the common elements of modern API lifecycle to existing WSDL services.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Document</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Having complete, accurate, and easy to follow documentation is essential for all APIs, and is something that  alleviates the number one pain point for API consumers when it comes to onboarding with any API, expanding the number of API paths an application puts to work. Modern approaches to producing API documentation have moved beyond a single static version of documentation simply published to a portal, as well as there being potentially multiple forms of documentation for any single API. Helping API producers onboard consumers easier, reduce the cognitive load when understanding what an API does, and properly define specific business use cases of an API being put to work in an application or as part of an integration.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Test</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API delivers the intended outcomes it was developed for in the first place, providing manual as well as automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly and is as performant as required, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs. API testing should not be an afterthought and should be a default aspect of the API lifecycle for any API being put into production. API testing takes a solid investment in establishing proper testing practices across teams, but once you do the work to establish a baseline of testing, properly train teams on the process and tooling involved, the investment will pay off down the road.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Secure</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Security must be its own area of the API lifecycle, but it is something that should span testing, authentication, and potentially other areas of the API lifecycle. Over the last five years the world of API security has expanded, while also moving further left in the API lifecycle as part of a devops shift in how APIs are delivered. There are a number of elements present when it comes to security, but depending on the overall maturity of API operations the available resources and prioritization available to adequately realize these elements vary.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Monitor</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Monitors can be used to execute any Postman collection applied to any environment. Due to the versatility of what a Postman collection can define, collections turn monitors into a powerful API automation and orchestration tool. Beginning with the ability to schedule contract, performance, and other types of tests, but then also allowing for automating specific workflows across many different APIs. Since collections can be used to define anything that can be defined via an API, monitors can be used to schedule the running of each capability from multiple cloud regions, applying many different environmental variables. Making monitors an essential, versatile, and executable part of defining how the API lifecycle works.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Discover</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">The ability to discover APIs at all stages of the API lifecycle is essential for reducing redundancy across operations, helping teams find existing APIs before they develop new ones, properly matching API consumers with the right APIs, while supporting documentation, relevant workflows, and the feedback loops that exist as part of the operation of APIs internally within the enterprise, or externally with 3rd party developers. API discovery does not live at the beginning or the end of the API lifecycle, but should be considered across all areas of the API lifecycle, ensuring that APIs, as well as the operations around them are as discoverable as possible, but well informed when it comes to privacy, security, and terms of service.</p>
