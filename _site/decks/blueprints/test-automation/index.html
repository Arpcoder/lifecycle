				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Define</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">The most important first step of any API lifecycle is to make sure the operations around an API are properly defined, laying the foundation for being able to effectively design and bring an API to life, while also establishing a known place, or places to go to get all the information you need regarding each individual API, or groups of APIs. A little planning and organization at this early step of the API journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications and integrations that will depend on each internal, partner, or public API being delivered.</p>

						<h3>Contract Testing Monitor</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Monitors can be setup for all API contract testing, scheduling the run of contract testing when needed and configuring to run from the regions that matter most to business operations, making sure that each individual API contract is never breaking with consumers, making sure that each API is delivering as expected on a 24/7 schedule.</p>
