				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Define</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Ensuring that operations supporting an API is properly defined, as well as what is needed to properly design and bring an API to life. A little planning and organization at this step of an APIs journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications that depend on this internal, partner, or public API.</p>

						<h3>Workflow Collection</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Defining workflows across many APIs and API paths provide a rich way to design and document common business workflows and practices, providing a specific sequence of API requests needed to accomplish a business objective, or just a subset of a larger API that meets the needs of a specific business sector, helping go beyond just a reference of everything an API does and getting closer to the business value.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Document</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Having complete, accurate, and easy to follow document is essential for all APIs, helping alleviate the number one pain point for API consumers when it comes to onboarding with an API, as well as expanding the number of API paths an application puts to work, making API documentation one of the most important areas of the API lifecycle.</p>

						<h3>Workflow Documentation</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Providing documentation for workflow collections help introduce consumers to what a workflow define across multiple API requests can accomplish, and potentially provide a sequential walk through of each step of the flow, allowing API consumers to quickly understand what a workflow accomplishes, but also provides all the details of the workflow in an well documented executable format.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Test</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API accomplishes the intended purpose it was developed for, providing manual and automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly, is as performant as required, and meets the security expectations of everyone involved, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs.</p>

						<h3>Workflow Testing</h3>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Monitor</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">All tests applied to an API should be monitored on a logical schedule and from relevant geographic regions, monitoring that APIs aren't breaking their contract, falling below their agreed upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible.</p>
