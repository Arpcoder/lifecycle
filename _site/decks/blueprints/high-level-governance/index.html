				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Define</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">API governance needs to be well defined, beginning with defining the overall API lifecycle, which this project is dedicated to doing, and the establishment of a formal strategy. Without properly defining of what governance is, and how it will be applied across the API lifecycle, it will never be realized. To establish API governance at the highest levels within an organization you need a well defined view of what is happening today across operations, and coherent articulation of where we should be going. This definition will not every e complete, but more of an ongoing journey for an organization to define itself.</p>

						<h3>API Lifecycle</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">It is impossible to govern an API lifecycle that is not defined. It takes a clear and articulate definition of how the API lifecycle is put into motion across teams to reach a point where you can measure, guide, enforce, and evolve how APIs move across a well-defined API lifecycle in any consistent way. -</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Organization</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">The structure and leadership of governance will need to be established for API governance to move forward at the highest levels, otherwise it will just be a low-level vision that a handful of teams are able to realize. The organization of governance needs to reflect the organization where it is being applied in order to have greatest impact. To do this, you have to invest resources, time, and people to helping organize, lead, and guide teams in learning about, understanding, applying, reporting, and providing feedback on what is working and what is not working when it comes to governance.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Rules</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">API governance rules codifies what API governance is as it is applied as part of the design, development and build process on the ground floor of API operations. Rules provide the benchmark for what governance is across teams, and provide an artifact that can be applied across the API lifecycle by individual designers and developers, and eventually baked into the pipelines that move API infrastructure forward. Rules should reflect what is happening on the ground today, but apply enforcement as part of a forward motion, acknowledging that legacy APIs may not always rise to the level governance an organization is moving towards.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Reporting</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Reporting on the realities and outcomes of API governance across the API lifecycle is needed to make it more visual and tangible for everyone involved. Reporting across governance being applied to individual APIs, groups of APIs, and overall operations can be realized as part of native platform reporting, customized, localized or in aggregate with Postman Visualizer, or made seamless with existing operations by piping data into APM and other systems to make available for reporting and visualizations via dashboards.</p>
