				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Definition</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">You can't govern what you don't have define, and to be able to begin governing the design of your APIs you will need to have machine readable artifacts that you can lint as part of the design, develop, or build process. Establishing a set of artifacts that help drive the API lifecycle, but also make it something that can be measured and reported upon as part of governance activities.</p>

						<h3>OpenAPI</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">The OpenAPI specification provides a common vocabulary for describing the surface area of request and response APIs, as well as webhooks, ensuring that API producers and consumers are on the same page when it comes to integration, but also helps stabilize multiple areas of the API lifecycle providing a contract that can be used for delivering documentation, mocks, testing, and more.</p>

						<h3>AsyncAPI</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">AsyncAPI is a machine readable specification for describing the surface area of your asynchronous APIs. OpenAPI is meant for describing synchronous APIs like REST using HTTP, and AsymcAPI is for describing websockets, MQTT, Kafka, NATS, and other syncrhonous, event-driven, and message APIs.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Application</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Once you have an OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, or other artifact that you would like to apply governance too, there are a handful of ways in which you can execute governance as part of your regular work. Depending on your goals with governing the design of an API you can apply each of these elements helping manual or automatically identify problems with the design of your API. These approaches to execution are potentially dependent on other rules, as well as the approach you take to automating the application of governance.</p>

						<h3>Rules-Based Linting</h3>

						<h3>Script-Based Governance</h3>
						<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">A script-based approach to governance involves using the same collection based approach used to apply contract, performance, and other types of testing with Postman collections, but instead of testing an instance of an API, you are testing the surface area of the API by pulling the OpenAPI and writing test scripts for specific governance assertions.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Rules</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">API governance rules codifies what API governance is as it is applied as part of the design, development and build process on the ground floor of API operations. Rules provide the benchmark for what governance is across teams, and provide an artifact that can be applied across the API lifecycle by individual designers and developers, and eventually baked into the pipelines that move API infrastructure forward. Rules should reflect what is happening on the ground today, but apply enforcement as part of a forward motion, acknowledging that legacy APIs may not always rise to the level governance an organization is moving towards.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;">Automation</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">To realize governance across operations it is important that governance is applied in automated ways at different areas of the API lifecycle, helping ensure API governance can be applied early on in the lifecycle, but is also available throughout the development and delivery of aPIs, and when it makes sense bake it into the build process ensuring that governance is applied by default as every API moves into production. Helping ensure that teams aren't doing extra work to realize governance across operations, and it is just at their fingertips as they are design, developing, and building APIs as part of their regular day.</p>
