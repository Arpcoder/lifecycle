				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Each API being submitted as part of an API design review process should possess the necessary artifacts and elements needed to properly evaluate the design of each API. To ensure the API design review is as efficient and effective as possible it helps to have a dedicated location for the review to happen, with everything present to to conduct review, and provide feedback around the API, as well as supporting elements. Setting the stage for a speedy but effective review, sending an API back development, or allowing it to move everything forward to production.</p>

				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left;">Once ready, with all the needed artifacts and element, an API should be submitted to a well defined process for reviewing the design of an API, then providing feedback on the state of an API, and whether it is ready for production, in as short of time as possible. Reaching a desireable outcome that upholds an organization's design guidelines, and helps make teams better at what they do. Ensuring that eery API design review is a learning opportunity for both designer and reviewer. Continuing to improve the API design process with each API submitted for review, making operations incrementally better along the way.</p>
