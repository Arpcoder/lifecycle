It takes a clear and articulate definition of how the API lifecycle is put into motion across teams to reach a point where you can measure, guide, enforce, and evolve how APIs move across a well-defined API lifecycle in any consistent way. -</textarea><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>This project is all about defining the base of the API lifecycle and the different entry points and priorities that exist across the API lifecycle so that we can better understand, measure, and ultimately govern how APIs move through the API lifecycle. Without governance applying to all areas of the API lifecycle, you cannot effectively govern APIs and achieve the velocity and symmetry needed to move an entire organization forward. An API lifecycle should augment and overlap with the existing software development lifecycle within an organization but work to support the specific needs of APIs, acknowledging they are central to desktop, web, mobile, and device applications and the overall IT operations and infrastructure behind everything.</p>

But in the last decade, the word is also being used to describe devices, network, and other ways we can apply digital resources today. Applications are the tangible result of API consumption that end-users see and put to work in their personal and professional lives. It is common for APIs to be developed to serve a single application. Still, increasingly organizations are looking to deliver APIs independent of specific applications and can be used across several different known and unknown applications.</p>

Backing up any artifacts, policies, code, and data behind the API for future reference and possibly putting back into production if needed. This approach allows APIs to be audited, but from the consumer’s external view of API consumers, the API had been removed from servers, gateway, or any other API infrastructure. Ensuring that deprecated APIs do not exist in production helps limit vulnerabilities while allowing for deprecated APIs to be retrieved if needed at any time in the future.</p>

Next, authentication can be defined as part of API consumption at the collection, folder, or individual request level, providing a configurable authentication layer for automating across API operations. Authentication should be balanced across both the producer and consumer side of the API lifecycle, putting well-known practices to work, allowing both sides to securely access, refresh, and engage with necessary authentication.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Automation centers around the collection, which can be automated using runners, monitors, or as part of CI/CD pipelines using the open source Newman. Collections can be used to define any single or series of API calls, complete with authentication, providing a very versatile and executable unit of API value. A well organized collection can define many API calls arranged in a specific order and organized by folder, which when ran provides a well defined and repeatable series of API-driven actions. The automation of collection comes into the picture once you begin scheduling these collections to run on a schedule or become baked into each commit to a repo as part of it’s pipeline. Opening up the doorway to a potentially unlimited number of possibilities for API automation as part of the delivery of APIs, or as part of the consumption and integration of digital resources and capabilities across many different APIs. Collections plus monitors are your doorway to the world of API automation today.</p>

Postman collections are executable units that can be run individually and sequentially as part of a CI/CD pipeline, publishing documentation, running contract, integration, and performance tests, or leverage infrastructure APIs behind our APIs to automate any part of the API lifecycle. Jenkins, Github Actions, and other CI/CD solutions allow for the execution of manually created or dynamically generated Postman collections, providing an excellent mechanism for standardizing how API lifecycle automation occurs across many different APIs, while also utilizing a standardized approach to moving APIs forward as part of an agreed upon API lifecycle.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Postman is a web and desktop API client designed to help test, troubleshoot, and debug APIs. API clients go beyond interactive documentation, allowing you to configure all aspects of each request, publish, or subscribe to an API, controlling as many of the details including authentication, headers, and other often invisible aspects of working with APIs. API clients work much like your API browsers in letting you navigate the API landscape, but are not intended to abstract away how the web works, but work to reveal all of the ways you can configure HTTP, Websockets, and the other technical details of how APIs operate. An API client is a critical part of the API lifecycle for both API producers and consumers, providing an interface for working with APIs, but also allowing to save, share, and collaborate with others when it comes to putting APIs to work.</p>

Abstracting many of the details of integration with an API away from view, providing a simple and familiar interface in the language of choice for each developer. It is common for API providers today to auto-generate client-side SDKs from OpenAPI or even subsets of an API for a specific business use case using a well-defined collection. SDKs can be generated, forked, and then tailored to help automate the deployment of API integrations, reducing much of the overhead developers are going to face when integrating. In recent years, a wealth of commercial and open source tooling has emerged to help API producers provide robust and complete SDKs for their APIs.</p>

Developers won’t always need access to the full surface area of an API present in a complete SDK, and will benefit from accessing a single API call via a client-side code snippet in their language of choice. Like SDKs, client-side code snippets can be auto-generated from OpenAPI and Postman collections, and are playing an increasing role in serverless approaches to API integration and automation. Client-side code snippets help reduce the cognitive load for developers who are onboarding, and help ensure an API speaks their native language, allowing them to go from learning to making an API call in as short of period as possible.</p>

Code annotations can be used to generate OpenAPI, collections, and other machine readable artifacts that can then be used to produce documentation, tests, and other elements of the API lifecycle. Many organizations rely on developers to produce each version of an API, and then automate the generation of documentation, tests, and other elements from the annotation, reducing the role of the developer in having to learn and understand API specification formats and change their existing behavior beyond just annotating each portion of the code they are responsible for within their IDE.</p>

Collections resemble OpenAPI often times in how they are used, but diverge when it comes to being able to derive different documentation, mocks, tests, and complete or subsets of an API, providing a machine readable representation, but also one that can be executed as part of different lifecycle processes. Collections can contain many different API requests that can be organized by folders, possessing all the technical details of each API request, but also contains authorization, scripts, and other useful elements. Collections are the heartbeat of the Postman API platform, and begin with helping save requests defined while using Postman as an API client, but can also be applied to almost every stop along the API lifecycle when producing APIs, and speed up integration and automation for API consumers. Collections are extremely versatile, and represent a low-code vision of what is possible when it comes to working with APIs.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>JSON Schema can be used to define specific patterns that should exist within each OpenAPI or AsyncAPI contract being defined as part of the design, development, and operation of an API. Contract-based always begins with adhering to the specification for OpenAPI or AsyncAPI using their own JSON Schema document, but is something that can be extended to other patterns like pagination, extensions, or domain specific design pattern. A contract-based approach to governance can assist in going beyond rules based governance by allowing for more complex patterns to be checked, but utilizes existing approaches used across other areas of the API lifecycle, making it something within reach of teams. Helping establish a common set of patterns that can be applied manually or automatically throughout the life of an API to help make sure it applies common API design practices within an organization or industry.</p>

While it is common for API developers to directly expose data sources as create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) APIs, it is much more desirable to expose data sources as well designed API paths, as well as via GraphQL and other query languages. Data sources and APIs have a natural relationship as part of the development and delivery of APIs, but there are a variety of approaches you can take to connect data sources via your APIs.</p>

However, it is common for many teams to not think about deprecation early on as they are focused on only delivering new features and increasing the adoption of an API. Even with this reality there should still be a formal strategy for developers to consider when it comes to how they should be thinking about API deprecation, providing a common blueprint they can follow to properly shut-down an API without causing friction with consumers.</p>

Some design patterns come from approaches like REST, while others are more standardized like JSON API, or Hypermedia media types. The more consistent design patterns that are used as part of the delivery of an API the more likely it is to be familiar and adopted by consumers. As API providers we just shouldn’t be re-inventing the wheel with things like pagination, and utilizing as many web standards as we possibly can. Design patterns should be a regular part of the API lifecycle discussion from design to production, and teams should have access to a robust toolbox of design patterns and supporting educational resources as they iterate upon API infrastructure.</p>

Beyond these areas of the API lifecycle, the process of producing rich examples for each individual API request or response, and multiple examples for different use cases helps better inform API designers and developers as part of the journey, resulting in a much richer API developer experience in the end.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 100px;" name="description">API gateways provide a centralized or federated approach to the deployment and management of APIs at scale across an organization, leveraging commercial or open source API gateways to deploy APIs into development, staging, production, or other environment, allowing for the standardization of common elements of API management, and configuring APIs using common policies.</textarea><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Gateways are an essential part of a modern API lifecycle, providing a standardized way for providing access to APIs. Gateways are available as commercial or open source offerings, and are a default part of cloud infrastructure, having been commoditized around 2015, and since become critical to the enterprise API lifecycle. Gateways use OpenAPI and other artifacts to define routes, and often use extensions to route requests to backend systems, while applying consistent policies across APIs to define identity and access control, transformations, logging, and other common needs involved in managing APIs. In addition to API deployment, API gateways are how API producers are able to stay aware of how API consumers are putting APIs to work, establishing awareness of how API resources are being applied–offering another direction for API gateway usage within Postman by pulling identity, access, and usage data back into the platform, and making it part of how teams stay informed across the API lifecycle.</p>

API governance has a symbiotic relationship with every stop along the API lifecycle, but definitely begins and evolves as part of the design of the surface area of each API, and the establishment of machine readable artifacts like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema that help formalize how we talk about API governance, but also how we measure and enforce that governance is being realized across teams.</p>

Potentially using the OpenAPI for an API to generate tests, or generate collections that can be used to define specific business objectives or business scenarios. JSON Schema provides the details of the integration, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable integration that can be manually or automatically tested against, ensuring that each API doesn’t change over time. It is common for collections to be define for the integration tests for each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines. Providing robust coverage for integration tests that developers can manually run, or automate as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

While there are exceptions to this rule, most APIs require developers to register an application, select a usage plan, then are issued a key that is required to accompany every API call. API keys are a ubiquitous aspect of API consumption, and an essential part of the API lifecycle for API producers. Keys are managed via the gateway and management layer for APIs, and should be considered as part of both the producer and consumer side of the lifecycle, when it comes to issuing, managing, and then applying keys across many different environments.

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Reference documentation for APIs should exist for any API, providing a complete reference of all API paths available, but when it comes to helping reduce the cognitive load for developers when they are onboarding, it can help having a subset or specialized set of documentation designed to onboard developers as quickly as possible. Onboarding API documentation provides the details of only the most common paths developers will need to get up and running with an API, or maybe a specific set of paths that a certain type of partner within an industry will need to get up and running. Onboarding API documentation helps make APIs more accessible and reduces friction for developers when it comes to going from discovery to integration, in as few steps as possible.</p>

OpenAPI can be introduced in different ways via the API lifecycle, but once introduced should be managed as the source of truth for each API, always keeping up to date and managed via Postman workspace as well as synced to relevant repositories. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections for documentation, mocking, testing, and other areas of the API lifecycle, providing executable representations of each API tailored for a specific purpose, while maintaining a single source of truth for the contract of each API that can be used to keep docs, mocks, and tests in sync, but also to validate that each API contract is being met.</p>

An overview for each API allows anyone that is interested to get up to speed on an API with just a few moments of scanning what is available on the overview page or dashboard. Overviews provide a snapshot of what is happening with an API, but also provide insight into the lifecycle of an API, showing multiple versions, what stage an API is in of it’s evolution, and other elements related to the forward motion of an API. Overviews are essential to the operation of healthy APIs, helping ensure everyone is in alignment around each individual API, but also across APIs at scale.</p>

The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% coverage for all of the API paths present, or performance tests can be applied to just a subset of API paths. It makes sense to have performance test collections separate from other types of testing so that they can be run independently from contract, integration, or other types of tests.

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Postman collections provide an excellent format for prototyping an API, driving the API design process from a collection, rather than an OpenAPI definition. Collections allow you to define all of the details for each API request and response, providing actual examples of what will be delivered. Since collections can be easily documented and mocked, they allow for very rapid iteration on the design of APIs in a very collaborative way, without having to be an expert on OpenAPI. Once a prototype has stabilized and changes are becoming less frequent an OpenAPI can be be generated and established as the source truth, providing an alterative approach to API design-first that will be more familiar to a wider audience of developers.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>A proxy server acts as a security barrier between your internal network and the Internet, keeping others on the Internet from accessing information on your internal network. In basic web speak, a client makes a request to the server, and the server sends back a response. A proxy server is an application or system that acts as an intermediary between your computer and the internet, or more specifically, the client and server. The proxy makes requests on your behalf to websites, servers, and other internet services. The proxy can reside on your local machine, somewhere in your network, or at any point between your client and the destination server on the internet. The Postman proxy allows you to assert more control over the API traffic behind applications, and capture, save, replay, and automate around the requests you capture.</p>

The public network is where teams can discover other public APIs they can put to work, or help make their own public APIs more discoverable by other 3rd party consumers. APIs can be published to the public network by changing the visibility of the workspaces they are in to be public, making the APIs, collections, environments, and other elements viewable by anyone browsing or searching the Postman public API network. The public network isn’t just about API discovery, it is also about helping bring observability and engagement with public API consumers more discoverable and accessible. Moving from the many siloed API portals of the past, where API producers work to build their own API ecosystems, to where API producers just participate as part of a larger API platform ecosystem–where developers already exist.</p>

Ideally reference documentation is logically organized using folders and tags, and provides informative and useful summaries and descriptions for every individual path. Every API should have up to date and informative reference documentation that allows API consumers to understand the entire scope of an API, but also find exactly the path or paths they need to use as part of their application or integration. Reference documentation for all APIs is an essential part of a healthy API lifecycle, but teams should also be considering what other forms of documentation would help new users, specific domains, as well as describing some of the most common workflows an API is used for when it comes to desired business outcomes.</p>

The retirement of an API can involve updating documentation to reflect the retirement state of an API, adding a potential header that goes out with each API response, as well as sending out notifications and other communications with consumers that an API has reached the retirement stage. Retirement is the stage that signals to consumers that an API is still available for use, but will not be evolving forward anymore, and at some date in the near future it will eventually be deprecated.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>A script-based approach to applying governance to any OpenAPI or AsyncAPI is the flexible approach to governance allowing for almost any type of assertion or desired outcome, but will require custom scripting to define each governance assertion. The OpenAPI or AsyncAPI for an API can be pulled via a URL or the Postman API, and then test scripts can be written to traverse and apply a variety of custom assertions, looking for problems in the design of each API. As with other API testing, the test results pane or visualizer can be used to report on the findings, alerting the developer that something is wrong with the design and what needs to be fixed, or throw an error to trigger the failure of a pipeline at build time. A script-based approach to governance will provide the widest flexibility, but require the most investment to develop the scripts needed to enforce governance across known API artifacts.</p>

Scripting utilizes JavaScript as used on the server by Node.js, as well as in the browser, but embeds the JavaScript into each individual request allowing for the manipulation of each API request as it runs, and then the ability to work with the results of each response for automation, storage, or even visualization using the Postman Visualizer. Scripting represents the greatest opportunity for automation across APIs and represents functionality that is not found on any other platform in a way that is as versatile as collections and environments empowered through the pre-request and post-request scripting capabilities. Providing a low-code environment for developers to automate on top of APIs, but then save, share, and publish as a no-code collection that anyone can execute without having to write code–widening who can put APIs to work within any organization.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Search is the fundamental element of API discovery, allowing API producers to search for existing APIs before they begin the development of new APIs, as well as API consumers to search for APIs they can use as part of their applications and integrations. A healthy API lifecycle depends on the ability to search internally and externally for APIs, as well as the operations around them. The indexing of workspaces, APIs, and the elements of the API lifecycle like documentation, mock servers, and tests should occur by default across all teams before the desired efficiency and velocity will be realized across operations. Postman platform search provides visibility across these dimensions of API operations, looking across private, partner, and public dimensions, but then also leverages a role based approach to what elements of API operations are surfaced based upon your role–making API search a priority as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>The securing of API infrastructure should be the number one concern for organizations. With the number of APIs powering desktop, web, mobile, and device applications, the surface area for vulnerabilities is only increasing, raising the stakes when it comes to how secure an organization. This element of the API lifecycle spans multiple other areas including management via authentication, and testing using security testing and monitoring practices. Security is about not just securing each individual API, but also being able to consistently apply it across hundreds or thousands of APIs. How secure an organization is is increasingly dependent on how teams are able to apply the latest security practices as part of their regular work without having to become security experts on top of their existing role. Because of this DevOps shift in how our organizations are operating, security is shifting left and becoming something that isn’t an afterthought or a stage of the API lifecycle later on, and moving earlier on in the design and development of APIs.</p>

No API should move into production without having a security collection defined for testing for all of the known vulnerabilities, moving the security conversation further left in the API lifecycle–allowing developers to manually test as they develop an API, but then also allowing for the automation of API security testing as part of the deployment pipeline, or scheduled via a monitor.

The code that gets generated is rarely complete in that it fully works at time of generation, with most just tackling much of the redundant work in assembling the scaffolding, inputs, outputs, or the “skeleton” of the back-end code needed to power an API. Even with this limitation the generation of server side code saves a lot of time and resources when it comes to developing new, or iterating upon existing APIs. The Postman API platform allows for server-side code generation in a variety of languages, and there are also a number of open source libraries available to the generation of code for different platforms, and in each of the popular programing languages using OpenAPI, Swagger, and Postman Collections.</p>

The most common way to share API lifecycle artifacts is across workspaces with different levels of access by team members, partners, and the general public. APIs, collections, and environments can be easily shared across workspaces designed to target a specific team or audience. Next, sharing of collections can be done using the URL to the raw JSON behind, or by publishing the collection using the Run in Postman button, which can be embedded in any HTML page. Sharing is a fundamental ingredient for how API operations move forward and act as the factory floor for an organization. Without sharing there is no internal collaboration amongst team members or engagement with the public across the API lifecycle.</p>

Usage plans are a standard part of API gateways and management solutions, and provide mechanisms for defining rate limiting and other access policies in a standardized way. Usage plans govern how APIs can be used across internal and external consumers, ensuring that no API has unlimited access or usage, requiring all consumers to be identified by a key, and providing observability into API usage by individual consumers, or across an entire plan. Usage plans are central to the management of public and private APIs, and are how the value exchange between API producers and consumers is maximized, ensuring all API usage is in alignment with business objectives.</p>

Therefore, its purpose is roughly similar to that of a type signature in a programming language. A WSDL can be imported or created from scratch to kick-off an API lifecycle, using the web service definition to generate documentation, mock servers, or tests, allowing legacy SOAP web services to managed as part of a more modern API lifecycle, bringing it up to par with other more modern microservices and APIs when it comes to elements of their operation.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 100px;" name="description">Providing documentation for workflow collections help introduce consumers to what a workflow define across multiple API requests can accomplish, and potentially provide a sequential walk through of each step of the flow, allowing API consumers to quickly understand what a workflow accomplishes, but also provides all the details of the workflow in an well documented executable format.</textarea><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Workflow collections come with documentation by default. Every request and response that gets defined will automatically include the ability to provide summaries and descriptions to help consumers understand what happens with each step. However, it is up to the workflow collection developer and owner to ensure that the overall workflow is adequately described, as well as how rich the summaries and descriptions are for each request or step of the workflow, as well as what can be expected when the workflow is executed manually, via monitor, or as part of a pipeline. Workflow documentation ensures that all automation across API operations has the potential to be properly documented, so that when there is turnover in staff that all elements of automation possess all the details regarding their operation by default.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Workflow collection tend to utilize pre-request and post-requests scripting for the automation before and after each individual request is executed, but because post-request scripts are also often used for API testing and possess a rich assertion library, they can also be used to test the outcomes and results of each business workflow defined as a collection. Allowing for the testing of each individual step of a workflow, iteration, as well as the overall outcomes of the workflow run, allowing for not just the testing of individual APIs, but of entire business workflows needed to power operations. Taking testing to a whole other level, allowing testing to be closer aligned to actual business objectives, and not just individual technical components of IT operations.</p>

Allowing any business workflow to be automated and run on a regular schedule with each execution potentially reporting and saving the results of it’s run, as well as any data that was collected as part of it’s execution. Putting the automation and orchestration in the low-code / no-code world, allowing specific business workflows to be run whenever they are needed and containing the proper testing to ensure that everything executed as expected, and the desired business outcomes were achieved. Allowing for the automation of anything defined as a collection, which is defined by any capability that can be defined as an API–leaving for a pretty wide world of automation possibilities.</p>
