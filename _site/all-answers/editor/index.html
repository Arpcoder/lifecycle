                    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">How do you become an API-first company?</span><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 100px;" name="description">To become an API-first company you need to establish an API platform, layer on an well-known API lifecycle, establish standardized processes for designing, documenting, testing, and monitoring APIs across teams, and invest in a platform-led approach to realizing API governance across the enterprise.</textarea><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Becoming API-first begins with planning and taking small incremental steps to define, standardize, and perpetually optimize how you deliver and operate your applications and integrations using APIs. Establishing a strategy for how you quantify, but also move forward APIs consistently and reliably across the enterprise, redefining your teams and operations by making a commitment to rebuilding your enterprise operations in an API-first world with the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establishing a strategy for how you deliver and manage APIs across teams using a well-known API lifecycle.</li>
  <li>Always plan APIs as part of a wider API strategy before you develop any web, mobile, or device applications.</li>
  <li>Mapping all of the APIs that exist using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Collections across operations.</li>
  <li>Invest in API infrastructure to make APIs available externally to an organization to partners and the public.</li>
  <li>Provide contract and performance tests for all API that are used in CI/CD pipelines and scheduled via monitors.</li>
  <li>Require there are always common security tests in place for all APIs enforced via CI/CD pipelines and monitors.</li>
  <li>Organize the development of all APIs using well-defined workspaces and repositories containing common artifacts.</li>
  <li>Providing teams with a well-known API lifecycle that they can confidently follow and put to work via workspaces.</li>
  <li>Setting up scheduled monitors across all of your APIs, then making sure they are always piped into your APM solution.</li>
  <li>Automate the governance of design documentation, testing, and monitoring consistently across all teams and APIs.</li>
  <li>Provide a design guideline for teams, and make sure to provide examples of how to apply common standards to APIs.</li>
  <li>Ensure there is discovery and observability across 100% of the APIs used to power applications and integrations.</li>
  <li>Investing in the optimization of your operations so that you can confidently allocate innovation time across teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be able to begin working in almost all of these areas as part of your regular operations through the prioritization, development, and iteration of a formal API platform and lifecycle strategy. Increasing investment in the enablement of teams who are designing, developing, and managing your APIs today. Understanding that API-first will help you optimize and improve how your teams are working today, allowing them to take the first steps towards moving your operations into an API-first world where you will be able to meet the future needs of your business.</p>

                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 100px;" name="description">There are many different ways to author an OpenAPI while leveraging the Postman API platform, accommodating a wide variety of priorities and existing workflows.</textarea><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>Like other stops along the API lifecycle, Postman is an API Swiss Army Knife, allowing for many different ways of executing similar tasks. When it comes to authoring an OpenAPI, we work to provide you with native workflows for composing directly within Postman API builder, but also outside of the platform, while still ensuring that each OpenAPI is available for use across the API lifecycle–here are some of the most common actions we see taken as part of OpenAPI authoring workflows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://apis.how/actions/create-a-new-openapi/">Create New in Postman API Builder</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apis.how/actions/import-openapi/">Import New in Postman Using API Builder</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apis.how/actions/author-an-openapi-in-api-builder/">Author in Postman API Builder</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apis.how/actions/author-an-openapi-in-open-source-editor/">Author in Open Source Solution</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apis.how/actions/sync-openapi-to-github/">Sync OpenAPI from Github</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://apis.how/actions/sync-openapi-using-the-postman-api/">Sync OpenAPI from Postman API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is optimal to edit OpenAPI definitions directly within the Postman API builder. Still, it is common for there to be off-platform OpenAPI authoring workflows that exist in multiple places. The Postman API builder allows for the greatest flexibility for authoring OpenAPI on the web and desktop, allowing for real-time collaboration and commenting around APIs, and keeping the contract in sync with documentation, mock servers, and testing. However, there is no reason that OpenAPIs can’t simultaneously be authored in other locations then synced with Postman via existing Git-enabled workflows and the Postman API. Providing the most flexibility when it comes to authoring an OpenAPI across teams.</p>

                    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">What is the timeline for Postman’s journey to becoming an API platform?</span><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 100px;" name="description">As an API solution, Postman has been evolving for over seven years, beginning as a simple API client, but then growing into a full fledge API platform that services the entire API lifecycle.</textarea><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>A common question we hear often is about what the Postman story is, and how we have evolved to become an API platform that supports the entire API lifecycle. Postman began as a simple API client and debugging tool, which quickly grew into a very adaptable API testing solution, but then has rapidly expanded to meet many other needs of our customers across the API lifecycle. While there are plenty of other capabilities that Postman has brought over the years, this timeline shows the core progression of Postman from a client into an API platform, which provides a reflection of many of our customer’s own journeys.</p>

<p>It all began with providing a simple API client to make developers’ lives easier:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>2013 - Client, Scripts, and Testing</strong> - Life began as a browser bases solution for testing and debugging APIs, helping developers understand how APIs work or do not work, then saving that understanding as a reusable, sharable collection that can be run by others.</li>
  <li><strong>2014 - Runner and CLI Runner</strong> - Collections become a standardized way to define, save, and then run one or many API requests that includes scripting for automation, allowing collections to be run on the desktop or via a command-line interface and CI/CD.</li>
  <li><strong>2015 - Documentation &amp; Code Generation</strong> - Documentation emerges as a priority, expanding the ability for developers to publish shareable and embeddable documentation that also has a variety of code snippets in different programming languages.</li>
  <li><strong>2016 - Github &amp; GitLab Integration</strong> - Source control integration for developers becomes important, allowing Postman to be more tightly linked to the developer’s existing software development lifecycle, allowing artifacts and tests to be kept in alignment with source control.</li>
  <li><strong>2016 - APM, Messaging Integration</strong> - Following source control, the need to integrate with existing APM, notification, and messaging systems became an important part of developers’ workflow to produce and consume APIs as part of their work.</li>
  <li><strong>2016 - Monitoring</strong> - Being able to schedule the monitoring of collection and extend the automation introduced by runners, and at the command line and CI/CD pipeline level, allowing contracts, performance, integration, and other tests to be monitored.</li>
  <li><strong>2017 - Mocking </strong> - Mocking is an essential part of the API lifecycle, and as part of testing, so Postman introduced the ability to deploy mock servers as defined by a collection and the examples it contains providing a simple way to create static mocks of APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>2018 - Team Workspaces, Comments, and Search</strong> - Acknowledging the need for closer collaboration across teams, workspaces were launched, as well as the ability to comment on collections, and search across workspaces, APIs, and collections.</li>
  <li><strong>2019 - Builder</strong> - With the increased usage of Postman to not just consume and test APIs, but also to deliver APIs, the API Builder was launched, allowing APIs to be designed and developed using OpenAPI, RAML, and GraphQL across team workspaces.</li>
  <li><strong>2019 - Interceptor</strong> - To support the reverse engineering of the existing APIs that exist behind web applications Postman interceptor was launched, allowing web traffic in Chrome to be captured and then used to define a Postman collection within a workspace.</li>
  <li><strong>2019 - Public Network</strong> - The public API network was launched to support the needs of public API producers needing to attract new users, but then also provide a public catalog for API consumers to use when looking for APIs to use in their applications.</li>
  <li><strong>2020 - Reporting</strong> - Reporting was launched to support the needs of the enterprise, providing a way for leadership to see activity across teams, workspaces, and APIs, helping understand activity and move towards more governance of API operations.</li>
  <li><strong>2020 - Private Network</strong> - The private API network was launched to support the need for enterprise organizations to have a single internal catalog where teams can publish and discover the APIs and microservices that are being developed across teams and workspaces.</li>
  <li><strong>2020 - Public Workspaces</strong> - The ability to change the visibility of a workspace to be publicly available was introduced to support the needs of API producers when it comes to engaging with consumers, allowing them to view, fork, and engage with their APIs.</li>
  <li><strong>2020 - Websockets</strong> - With the introduction of WebSockets, the platform signaled a migration towards being a multi-protocol API platform, supporting WebSockets, and socket.io, but laying the groundwork for gRPC, and support for other protocols.</li>
</ul>

<p>This timeline represents the journey of Postman from a browser extension to a desktop application then ultimately an API platform by listening to, and then supporting the needs of API consumers, but then also API producers. Providing what teams are needing when it comes to designing, developing, and operating their APIs, but also consuming and automating using private, partner, and public APIs.</p>

<p> This represents just a subset of the platform capabilities but reflects the Postman journey to become an API platform that will support the needs of the enterprise into the future. Providing a list of platform capabilities that can be mapped to enterprise organizations to get a handle on the productivity, quality, and overall governance of their operations.</p>

                    <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;">Why Should We Use API Specifications?</span><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 100px;" name="description">API specifications like OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema provide us with a shared vocabulary for describing the surface area of our APIs in exact and machine-readable ways.</textarea><br>
                    <textarea style="width: 100%; height: 150px;" name="content"><p>OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, and JSON Schema give us a human and machine-readable way to describe the surface area of our APIs. OpenAPI allows us to describe the details of synchronous, request, and response APIs, using JSON Schema to define what should be submitted and what a user can expect back as a response. AsyncAPI does the same thing but focuses on the more asynchronous event and message-driven APIs, describing the channels and other details, while also using JSON Schema to describe the objects being published and subscribed to each channel. API specifications describe the surface area of our APIs so that we can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Document</strong> - Generate human readable HTML documentation for each API.</li>
  <li><strong>Mock</strong> - Generate static mock servers that emulate what an API can do.</li>
  <li><strong>Test</strong> - Generate contract, performance, and other types of API tests.</li>
  <li><strong>Generate Code</strong> - Generate code in a variety of programming languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just a handful of the most common reasons API providers use API specifications. However, in addition to these API lifecycle benefits, API specifications provide us with a standard, widely understood way to describe the surface area of our APIs in a way that other developers will understand. API specifications help make how we communicate and collaborate around an API across the API lifecycle, helping increase team velocity when producing and consuming APIs. These API specifications are used by top API providers like eBay, Salesforce, Github, Twitter, and others to describe their APIs so that they can document, mock, test, and generate code across their API operations.</p>
