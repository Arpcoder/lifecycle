   <h1 class="h1">Test Automation</h1>
   <p><p>This blueprint focuses just on the test automation portion of the API lifecycle, highlighting the different types of tests that can be run, how monitors can be used to automate those tests on a schedule from multiple regions, and then how to tap into the observability opportunities that exist when it comes to test automation. Test automation should provide you with a 50K foot view of how testing works in conjunction with monitors, and what observability is available by default, published using visualizer, or introduced through integrations with external solutions, providing many different ways of being able to see and understand test automation for API operations.</p>

      <h3>Test</h3>
      <p>A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API accomplishes the intended purpose it was developed for, providing manual and automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly, is as performant as required, and meets the security expectations of everyone involved, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Contract Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Contract testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the contract that was put forth for each individual version of an API. OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections providing 100% coverage for all of the API paths present. JSON Schema provides the details of the contract, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable contract that can be manually or automatically tested against. It is common for collections to be defined for the contract tests of each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines, providing robust coverage for contract tests that developers can manually execute, or automated as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Performance testing establishes a benchmark for what can be expected when it comes to the response time for each API. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% coverage for all of the API paths present, or performance tests can be applied to just a subset of API paths. It makes sense to have performance test collections separate from other types of testing so that they can be run independently from contract, integration, or other types of tests. Helping establish that the performance levels are met from potentially different regions that reflect actual application usage of APIs. Providing a comprehensive look at the performance of an API from across multiple regions for 100%, or a sensible sampling of API paths, ensuring that APIs and the teams behind them are meeting their SLAs over time and across the entire API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Integration Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Integration testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the integration that was put for with each version. Potentially using the OpenAPI for an API to generate tests, or generate collections that can be used to define specific business objectives or business scenarios. JSON Schema provides the details of the integration, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable integration that can be manually or automatically tested against, ensuring that each API doesn’t change over time. It is common for collections to be define for the integration tests for each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines. Providing robust coverage for integration tests that developers can manually run, or automate as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any contract test, taking any collection of API requests, complete with test scripts, combined with a targeted environment, and run in a variety of cloud regions on a recurring schedule. Providing the ability to independently execute the contract testing for each API, but then monitor the contract testing of each API over time to make sure nothing has changed. Providing the essential automation of contract testing needed to ensure it is consistently applied across all APIs, defining whether or not an API is not just meeting the uptime portion of its service level agreement, but actually is meeting business needs in an ongoing way.</p>

            <p><p>When each collection is executed by a monitor it has a set of results that can be published to any location and saved for reporting upon and included in other dashboards.

Formalizing how test results inform API operations in real time, but also potentially providing historical data on the contract testing across teams and APIs.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any performance test, taking a single, or a variety of API paths and making sure they meet the established baseline for response time. Monitors take your performance testing collections and allow for their execution on a recurring schedule, from any cloud region, with a specific set of environment variables applied at execution time. It is important that performance testing exist as their own collections so that performance testing monitors can become more precise in where and when they run, providing a robust look at API performance from the regions and times of day that matter the most. Performance testing monitors are essential in realizing a certain quality of service at scale across all APIs in production, providing an executable unit for understanding the performance of all API resources and capabilities over time.</p>

      <h3>Observability</h3>
      <p>Tapping into the outputs available across API operations to understand what is happening with individual APIs throughout their lifecycle, but also in aggregate for domains, teams, and other logical groups, helping make API operations more visible in real time.</p>
         
      
         
            
            <h4>Activity</h4>
            <p><p>Being able to track on the activity that occurs across the design, development, and operation of APIs, provides the ability to see what changes are made by teams to APIs and the supporting artifacts. Ensuring that there is observability present across the management of each API without teams having to do amy additional work, tracking all changes, and then make this information visible to everyone involved. Providing an ongoing snapshot of the activity involved with moving each API forward, making sure nothing gets lost along the way. You can find activity for each workspace using the overview tab, as well as across workspaces via the home page of your Postman application.</p>

            <h4>Contract Testing Monitor Report</h4>
            <p><p>With the run of each contract test monitor the results can be viewed using visualizer at run time, or the results can be saved, and reported upon later. Contract testing monitor results can be viewed internally within Postman and each contract testing collection using the visualizer tab and supporting test script, keeping reporting localized to each API and it’s tests. Contract testing monitor results can also be piped into other APM solutions using integrations, allowing for reporting to occur within dashboards within existing APM solutions used by teams.</p>

            <h4>Application Performance Management (APM)</h4>
            <p><p>Postman doesn’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to application performance management and embraces the use of existing APM solutions by making them a first class integration within the platform, allowing you to integrate with Datadog, New Relic, and other APM solutions. Platform APM integrations allow you to pipe the results of any collection run via a monitor into existing APM infrastructure. This allows results of collection runs for contract, integration, performance, and other types of tests to be piped into APM solutions, providing visibility over the execution of any type of collection.</p>
