      <h3>Define</h3>
      <p>Ensuring that operations supporting an API is properly defined, as well as what is needed to properly design and bring an API to life. A little planning and organization at this step of an APIs journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications that depend on this internal, partner, or public API.</p>

            <h4>Reference Documentation</h4>
            <p><p>The most common form of API documentation is what can be described as reference documentation, providing a complete “menu” of all paths available for an API, along with all the parameters, headers, body, and examples to put to use. Ideally reference documentation is logically organized using folders and tags, and provides informative and useful summaries and descriptions for every individual path. Every API should have up to date and informative reference documentation that allows API consumers to understand the entire scope of an API, but also find exactly the path or paths they need to use as part of their application or integration. Reference documentation for all APIs is an essential part of a healthy API lifecycle, but teams should also be considering what other forms of documentation would help new users, specific domains, as well as describing some of the most common workflows an API is used for when it comes to desired business outcomes.</p>

      <h3>Test</h3>
      <p>A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API accomplishes the intended purpose it was developed for, providing manual and automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly, is as performant as required, and meets the security expectations of everyone involved, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Contract Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Contract testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the contract that was put forth for each individual version of an API. OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections providing 100% coverage for all of the API paths present. JSON Schema provides the details of the contract, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable contract that can be manually or automatically tested against. It is common for collections to be defined for the contract tests of each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines, providing robust coverage for contract tests that developers can manually execute, or automated as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Performance testing establishes a benchmark for what can be expected when it comes to the response time for each API. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% coverage for all of the API paths present, or performance tests can be applied to just a subset of API paths. It makes sense to have performance test collections separate from other types of testing so that they can be run independently from contract, integration, or other types of tests. Helping establish that the performance levels are met from potentially different regions that reflect actual application usage of APIs. Providing a comprehensive look at the performance of an API from across multiple regions for 100%, or a sensible sampling of API paths, ensuring that APIs and the teams behind them are meeting their SLAs over time and across the entire API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Security Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Security testing ensures that 100% of the surface area of an API is secure against the common types of attacks as defined by OWASP. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% test coverage for all API paths, ensuring that every API, and detail of the API is evaluated as part of common security practices. No API should move into production without having a security collection defined for testing for all of the known vulnerabilities, moving the security conversation further left in the API lifecycle–allowing developers to manually test as they develop an API, but then also allowing for the automation of API security testing as part of the deployment pipeline, or scheduled via a monitor. Security testing is just one part of a larger testing, but also security strategy, helping standardize how security is applied, while also properly equipping teams with the latest information and practices they need to be successful in securing API operations.</p>

upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible.</p>

      <p>The ability to discover APIs at all stages of the API lifecycle is key to reduce redundancy across operations, helping teams find existing APIs before they develop new ones, and properly match API consumers with the right APIs, supporting documentation, relevant workflows, and the feedback loops that exist as part of the operation of APIs internally within the enterprise, or externally with 3rd party developers.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Private Network</h4>
            <p><p>A private network is available for any team as part of the Postman platform. The private team network is accessible via the home page and provides a place to publish APIs, and each version of an API so they can be discovered by internal consumers. APIs can be added to the private network from the network itself, as well as part of managing the API within any workspace where the API is being managed. APIs in the private network will show up in the wider search, and allow for grouping and browsing by folder. Enabling teams who are producing APIs to easily increase the visibility of their APIs across teams, and beyond the workspaces where they are being developed. Increasing the chance that other teams will find before they begin developing a potentially duplicate API, or be able to put it to use within the application or integration they have planned.</p>

            <h4>Public Network</h4>
            <p><p>The Postman public network is where you will find APIs from leading providers like Stripe, Twilio, and Salesforce, while also being the place you can publish your own public APIs for discovery by millions of Postman users. The public network is where teams can discover other public APIs they can put to work, or help make their own public APIs more discoverable by other 3rd party consumers. APIs can be published to the public network by changing the visibility of the workspaces they are in to be public, making the APIs, collections, environments, and other elements viewable by anyone browsing or searching the Postman public API network. The public network isn’t just about API discovery, it is also about helping bring observability and engagement with public API consumers more discoverable and accessible. Moving from the many siloed API portals of the past, where API producers work to build their own API ecosystems, to where API producers just participate as part of a larger API platform ecosystem–where developers already exist.</p>

            <h4>Search</h4>
            <p><p>Search is the fundamental element of API discovery, allowing API producers to search for existing APIs before they begin the development of new APIs, as well as API consumers to search for APIs they can use as part of their applications and integrations. A healthy API lifecycle depends on the ability to search internally and externally for APIs, as well as the operations around them. The indexing of workspaces, APIs, and the elements of the API lifecycle like documentation, mock servers, and tests should occur by default across all teams before the desired efficiency and velocity will be realized across operations. Postman platform search provides visibility across these dimensions of API operations, looking across private, partner, and public dimensions, but then also leverages a role based approach to what elements of API operations are surfaced based upon your role–making API search a priority as part of the API lifecycle.</p>
