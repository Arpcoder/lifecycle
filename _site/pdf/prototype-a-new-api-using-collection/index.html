   <h1 class="h1">Prototype a New API Using a Postman Collection</h1>
   <p><p>Postman collections make it really easy to define the structure of an API, using requests to describe the paths, parameters, bodies, and headers, while using examples to demonstrate what will be returned with each response. When you combine collections with the ability to generate mock servers, and the built-in documentation that comes with each collection, you end up with a pretty robust way to prototype APIs. Allowing teams to collaboratively prototype what an API should do, demonstrating functionality, and documentation resources and capabilities along the way, rapdily defining what an API will do in production–without writing code, or hand-crafting an OpenAPI definition. Some teams will find this approach to delivering APIs much more desirable than hand-crafting an OpenAPI and generating mock servers and documentation from the OpenAPI, providing yet another way to approach a modern API lifecycle.</p>

      <h3>Define</h3>
      <p>Ensuring that operations supporting an API is properly defined, as well as what is needed to properly design and bring an API to life. A little planning and organization at this step of an APIs journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications that depend on this internal, partner, or public API.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Team Workspace</h4>
            <p><p>Any API you are looking to develop should have a known location where any stakeholder can get up to speed on what is happening with the development and operation of an API. Postman team workspaces provide a single location to publish APIs, documentation, mock servers, tests, and other artifacts, providing a known location that is discoverable across teams. Establishing early on a place for teams to engage around the design, development, and operation of an API, that makes the API lifecycle observable by default.</p>

            <h4>Team Members</h4>
            <p><p>Once a team or public workspace has been established for an API, or group of APIs, it is time to define and invite all relevant team members to the workspace. Sitting down to make sure your team is well defined and invited to your workspace and repositories allows you to think through who is involved, what roles they have in moving an API forward, and is something you can revisit on a regular basis. It is also something that allows others to easily see who is involved with an API, and who they can reach out to with questions or feedback through the life of an API.</p>

      <h3>Mock</h3>
      <p>Mocking how an API works and behaves provides an effective way for teams to collaborate, communicate, and iterate as part of the design of an API, but also is something that can be used as part of testing, or just providing a sandbox environment for API consumers to learn before they actually begin working with any API in production.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Mock Server</h4>
            <p><p>Mock servers provide a simulated reflection of what each API can do, mocking each path request, as well as the response. It is difficult to mock every feature of an API, but mock servers will get you about 75% of the way towards what you will experience in production. An easy to use mock server will help your team get hands on with what an API does, while also allowing them to quickly iterate upon the design and provide feedback without actually having to write code. Mock servers can be defined by generating Postman collections from OpenAPI definitions, and it even can make sense to have multiple mock servers tailored for specific business use cases or outcomes, providing usable representations of the value that an API will deliver in production. Mock servers can be made publicly available or restricted by API key, helping reduce friction for usage, while also potentially limiting who has access to mocked instances of an API.</p>

            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p><p>Examples are essential to API operations for helping demonstrate what an API does and how it can be used. Examples can accompany API documentation to make onboarding with an API much more intuitive, and examples could be used to mock an API during the design or testing parts of the API lifecycle. Examples can help API designers and developers think through what an API should do as part of the API design or prototyping process, and can be used to provide a sandbox environment for API consumers to learn about how APIs work without working with production data. Beyond these areas of the API lifecycle, the process of producing rich examples for each individual API request or response, and multiple examples for different use cases helps better inform API designers and developers as part of the journey, resulting in a much richer API developer experience in the end.</p>

      <h3>Document</h3>

            <h4>Reference Documentation</h4>
            <p><p>The most common form of API documentation is what can be described as reference documentation, providing a complete “menu” of all paths available for an API, along with all the parameters, headers, body, and examples to put to use. Ideally reference documentation is logically organized using folders and tags, and provides informative and useful summaries and descriptions for every individual path. Every API should have up to date and informative reference documentation that allows API consumers to understand the entire scope of an API, but also find exactly the path or paths they need to use as part of their application or integration. Reference documentation for all APIs is an essential part of a healthy API lifecycle, but teams should also be considering what other forms of documentation would help new users, specific domains, as well as describing some of the most common workflows an API is used for when it comes to desired business outcomes.</p>

            <h4>OpenAPI</h4>
            <p><p>The OpenAPI acts as the contract for any HTTP API, providing a machine readable way to describe the details of each request and response in a way that can be used across the entire API lifecycle. OpenAPI can be introduced in different ways via the API lifecycle, but once introduced should be managed as the source of truth for each API, always keeping up to date and managed via Postman workspace as well as synced to relevant repositories. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections for documentation, mocking, testing, and other areas of the API lifecycle, providing executable representations of each API tailored for a specific purpose, while maintaining a single source of truth for the contract of each API that can be used to keep docs, mocks, and tests in sync, but also to validate that each API contract is being met.</p>

      <p>A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API accomplishes the intended purpose it was developed for, providing manual and automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly, is as performant as required, and meets the security expectations of everyone involved, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Contract Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Contract testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the contract that was put forth for each individual version of an API. OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections providing 100% coverage for all of the API paths present. JSON Schema provides the details of the contract, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable contract that can be manually or automatically tested against. It is common for collections to be defined for the contract tests of each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines, providing robust coverage for contract tests that developers can manually execute, or automated as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Performance testing establishes a benchmark for what can be expected when it comes to the response time for each API. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% coverage for all of the API paths present, or performance tests can be applied to just a subset of API paths. It makes sense to have performance test collections separate from other types of testing so that they can be run independently from contract, integration, or other types of tests. Helping establish that the performance levels are met from potentially different regions that reflect actual application usage of APIs. Providing a comprehensive look at the performance of an API from across multiple regions for 100%, or a sensible sampling of API paths, ensuring that APIs and the teams behind them are meeting their SLAs over time and across the entire API lifecycle.</p>

The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% test coverage for all API paths, ensuring that every API, and detail of the API is evaluated as part of common security practices. No API should move into production without having a security collection defined for testing for all of the known vulnerabilities, moving the security conversation further left in the API lifecycle–allowing developers to manually test as they develop an API, but then also allowing for the automation of API security testing as part of the deployment pipeline, or scheduled via a monitor. Security testing is just one part of a larger testing, but also security strategy, helping standardize how security is applied, while also properly equipping teams with the latest information and practices they need to be successful in securing API operations.</p>

      <h3>Monitor</h3>
      <p>All tests applied to an API should be monitored on a logical schedule and from relevant geographic regions, monitoring that APIs aren't breaking their contract, falling below their agreed upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible.</p>

      <h3>Deploy</h3>
      <p>Establishing a well defined process for deploy an API helps teams deploy new APIs, as well as each future iteration of an API in a consistent and repeatable way, making sure APIs are deployed using known development, staging, production, other agreed upon stages that actively put to work the other elements like documentation, testing, while contributing to observability.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>CI/CD Pipeline</h4>
            <p><p>CI/CD pipelines are an essential part of automating the delivery of APIs, and there are multiple ways they can be used in conjunction with the Postman platform from deployment, to testing and governance. Postman collections are executable units that can be run individually and sequentially as part of a CI/CD pipeline, publishing documentation, running contract, integration, and performance tests, or leverage infrastructure APIs behind our APIs to automate any part of the API lifecycle. Jenkins, Github Actions, and other CI/CD solutions allow for the execution of manually created or dynamically generated Postman collections, providing an excellent mechanism for standardizing how API lifecycle automation occurs across many different APIs, while also utilizing a standardized approach to moving APIs forward as part of an agreed upon API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Gateway</h4>
            <p><p>Gateways are an essential part of a modern API lifecycle, providing a standardized way for providing access to APIs. Gateways are available as commercial or open source offerings, and are a default part of cloud infrastructure, having been commoditized around 2015, and since become critical to the enterprise API lifecycle. Gateways use OpenAPI and other artifacts to define routes, and often use extensions to route requests to backend systems, while applying consistent policies across APIs to define identity and access control, transformations, logging, and other common needs involved in managing APIs. In addition to API deployment, API gateways are how API producers are able to stay aware of how API consumers are putting APIs to work, establishing awareness of how API resources are being applied–offering another direction for API gateway usage within Postman by pulling identity, access, and usage data back into the platform, and making it part of how teams stay informed across the API lifecycle.</p>

      <p>APIs should be managed using a set of common, well-defined policies that define and govern how APIs are access via all stages of the lifecycle, and ensure that every API has relevant authentication, rate limits, logging, and other essential aspects of managing APIs at scale, helping strike a balance between making APIs accessible and the privacy and security concerns that exist.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Onboarding</h4>
            <p><p>The API management layer governs how consumers onboard with an API, providing developers with the ability to sign up for an account, select a usage plan, define their applications, and obtain API keys that they will use when making calls to an API. The onboarding process for each API is heavily influenced by the API gateway and management solution selected by API producers, offering a pretty well defined set of approaches to reducing friction when it comes to getting access to an API, allowing consumers to go from learning about an API to making their first API call in as short of period as possible. API onboarding should be standardized across all of an organization’s APIs, and is not an area teams should be reinventing the wheel–with API management solutions being a commodity, no organization should be hand-rolling their onboarding experience as part of modern API operations.</p>

            <h4>Usage Plan</h4>
            <p><p>Every API should operate within one or many well-defined usage plans. No API consumer, whether internal or external to an organization, should have access to an API outside of the definition of a usage plan that is governed at the API management layer. Usage plans are a standard part of API gateways and management solutions, and provide mechanisms for defining rate limiting and other access policies in a standardized way. Usage plans govern how APIs can be used across internal and external consumers, ensuring that no API has unlimited access or usage, requiring all consumers to be identified by a key, and providing observability into API usage by individual consumers, or across an entire plan. Usage plans are central to the management of public and private APIs, and are how the value exchange between API producers and consumers is maximized, ensuring all API usage is in alignment with business objectives.</p>

            <h4>Key</h4>
            <p><p>It is common practice to require API consumers to obtain an API key before they can access any API. While there are exceptions to this rule, most APIs require developers to register an application, select a usage plan, then are issued a key that is required to accompany every API call. API keys are a ubiquitous aspect of API consumption, and an essential part of the API lifecycle for API producers. Keys are managed via the gateway and management layer for APIs, and should be considered as part of both the producer and consumer side of the lifecycle, when it comes to issuing, managing, and then applying keys across many different environments. Standardizing how environment variables are used to apply keys across many different collections used to document, mock, test, and provide clients for APIs.</p>

      <h3>Discover</h3>
      <p>The ability to discover APIs at all stages of the API lifecycle is key to reduce redundancy across operations, helping teams find existing APIs before they develop new ones, and properly match API consumers with the right APIs, supporting documentation, relevant workflows, and the feedback loops that exist as part of the operation of APIs internally within the enterprise, or externally with 3rd party developers.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Private Network</h4>
            <p><p>A private network is available for any team as part of the Postman platform. The private team network is accessible via the home page and provides a place to publish APIs, and each version of an API so they can be discovered by internal consumers. APIs can be added to the private network from the network itself, as well as part of managing the API within any workspace where the API is being managed. APIs in the private network will show up in the wider search, and allow for grouping and browsing by folder. Enabling teams who are producing APIs to easily increase the visibility of their APIs across teams, and beyond the workspaces where they are being developed. Increasing the chance that other teams will find before they begin developing a potentially duplicate API, or be able to put it to use within the application or integration they have planned.</p>

            <h4>Public Network</h4>
            <p><p>The Postman public network is where you will find APIs from leading providers like Stripe, Twilio, and Salesforce, while also being the place you can publish your own public APIs for discovery by millions of Postman users. The public network is where teams can discover other public APIs they can put to work, or help make their own public APIs more discoverable by other 3rd party consumers. APIs can be published to the public network by changing the visibility of the workspaces they are in to be public, making the APIs, collections, environments, and other elements viewable by anyone browsing or searching the Postman public API network. The public network isn’t just about API discovery, it is also about helping bring observability and engagement with public API consumers more discoverable and accessible. Moving from the many siloed API portals of the past, where API producers work to build their own API ecosystems, to where API producers just participate as part of a larger API platform ecosystem–where developers already exist.</p>

            <h4>Search</h4>
            <p><p>Search is the fundamental element of API discovery, allowing API producers to search for existing APIs before they begin the development of new APIs, as well as API consumers to search for APIs they can use as part of their applications and integrations. A healthy API lifecycle depends on the ability to search internally and externally for APIs, as well as the operations around them. The indexing of workspaces, APIs, and the elements of the API lifecycle like documentation, mock servers, and tests should occur by default across all teams before the desired efficiency and velocity will be realized across operations. Postman platform search provides visibility across these dimensions of API operations, looking across private, partner, and public dimensions, but then also leverages a role based approach to what elements of API operations are surfaced based upon your role–making API search a priority as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Deprecate</h4>
            <p><p>API deprecation should be considered as early on in the lifecycle of an API as possible, establishing estimates for how long each version of an API will be maintained and what the overall lifespan of an API should look like. However, it is common for many teams to not think about deprecation early on as they are focused on only delivering new features and increasing the adoption of an API. Even with this reality there should still be a formal strategy for developers to consider when it comes to how they should be thinking about API deprecation, providing a common blueprint they can follow to properly shut-down an API without causing friction with consumers.</p>
