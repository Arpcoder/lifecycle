   <h1 class="h1">Generate OpenAPI a New API Using Code Annotations</h1>
   <p><p>Not all APIs and the teams developing them are able to embrace a design first approach to delivering APIs and sometimes it makes more sense for developers to write the code first, then provide annotations within the code that can be used to generate OpenAPI definitions for each API as part of the regular build process. It is important that there is an OpenAPI contract for each API, so that documentation, mocks, testing, and other elements can be generated, but not all teams will be able to hand-craft the OpenAPI from scratch. Making code annotations a valid approach to developing an API using a code-first approach, but still realizing the benefits of having an up to date machine readable contract present for each API as it evolves throughout the lifecycle.</p>

      <h3>Define</h3>
      <p>The most important first step of any API lifecycle is to make sure the operations around an API are properly defined, laying the foundation for being able to effectively design and bring an API to life, while also establishing a known place, or places to go to get all the information you need regarding each individual API, or groups of APIs. A little planning and organization at this early step of the API journey can go a long way towards ensuring the overall health and velocity of an API, and the applications and integrations that will depend on each internal, partner, or public API being delivered.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Team Workspace</h4>
            <p><p>Any API you are looking to develop should have a known location where any stakeholder can get up to speed on what is happening with the development and operation of an API. Postman team workspaces provide a single location to publish APIs, documentation, mock servers, tests, and other artifacts, providing a known location that is discoverable across teams. Establishing early on a place for teams to engage around the design, development, and operation of an API, that makes the API lifecycle observable by default. Team workspaces are only accessible internally to your team members who have an account under your designated organizational Postman team, making it available across search, and via workspace browsing for your team to discover and begin collaborating and working across APIs being developed within each workspace.</p>

            <h4>Team Members</h4>
            <p><p>Once a team or public workspace has been established for an API, or group of APIs, it is time to define and invite all relevant team members to the workspace. Sitting down to make sure your team is well defined and invited to your workspace and repositories allows you to think through who is involved, what roles they have in moving an API forward, and is something you can revisit on a regular basis. It is also something that allows others to easily see who is involved with an API, and who they can reach out to with questions or feedback through the life of an API.</p>

            <p><p>Github repositories can be used in conjunction with Postman throughout the API lifecycle, providing a way to keep artifacts synced, and automate the API lifecycle as part of the CI/CD process defined around a Github repository. Github repositories provides not just code source control, but also API source of truth as part of the deployment of APIs, that can be managed and kept in alignment with the rest of the API lifecycle using the Postman platform and seamless integrations with Github.</p>

      <p>The road to setting a new code-first or existing API on a road to a standardized API lifecycle often times begins with the generation of an OpenAPI from annotations in the code as part of a build process. Relying on annotations for each code method to produce an API for the surface area of the API, updating the OpenAPI, and other supporting documentation and tests using a CI/CD pipeline. Bypassing the API design process and going with a code-first approach to delivering an API, and relying on the pipeline for the existing software development lifecycle to generate the OpenAPI, and set in motion the delivery of documentation, testing, and other elements of the API lifecycle.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>CI/CD Pipeline</h4>
            <p><p>CI/CD pipelines are an essential part of automating the delivery of APIs, and there are multiple ways they can be used in conjunction with the Postman platform from deployment, to testing and governance. Postman collections are executable units that can be run individually and sequentially as part of a CI/CD pipeline, publishing documentation, running contract, integration, and performance tests, or leverage infrastructure APIs behind our APIs to automate any part of the API lifecycle. Jenkins, Github Actions, and other CI/CD solutions allow for the execution of manually created or dynamically generated Postman collections, providing an excellent mechanism for standardizing how API lifecycle automation occurs across many different APIs, while also utilizing a standardized approach to moving APIs forward as part of an agreed upon API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Code Annotations</h4>
            <p><p>Code annotations are a common way to generate API specifications from code. Relying on developers to deliver an API using traditional software development processes, but then annotating each method to define the inputs and outputs that would correspond to the API request and response each method delivers. Code annotations can be used to generate OpenAPI, collections, and other machine readable artifacts that can then be used to produce documentation, tests, and other elements of the API lifecycle. Many organizations rely on developers to produce each version of an API, and then automate the generation of documentation, tests, and other elements from the annotation, reducing the role of the developer in having to learn and understand API specification formats and change their existing behavior beyond just annotating each portion of the code they are responsible for within their IDE.</p>

            <h4>OpenAPI</h4>
            <p><p>The OpenAPI acts as the contract for any HTTP API, providing a machine readable way to describe the details of each request and response in a way that can be used across the entire API lifecycle. OpenAPI can be introduced in different ways via the API lifecycle, but once introduced should be managed as the source of truth for each API, always keeping up to date and managed via Postman workspace as well as synced to relevant repositories. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections for documentation, mocking, testing, and other areas of the API lifecycle, providing executable representations of each API tailored for a specific purpose, while maintaining a single source of truth for the contract of each API that can be used to keep docs, mocks, and tests in sync, but also to validate that each API contract is being met.</p>

      <h3>Document</h3>
      <p>Having complete, accurate, and easy to follow documentation is essential for all APIs, and is something that  alleviates the number one pain point for API consumers when it comes to onboarding with any API, expanding the number of API paths an application puts to work. Modern approaches to producing API documentation have moved beyond a single static version of documentation simply published to a portal, as well as there being potentially multiple forms of documentation for any single API. Helping API producers onboard consumers easier, reduce the cognitive load when understanding what an API does, and properly define specific business use cases of an API being put to work in an application or as part of an integration.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Reference Documentation</h4>
            <p><p>The most common form of API documentation is what can be described as reference documentation, providing a complete “menu” of all paths available for an API, along with all the parameters, headers, body, and examples to put to use. Ideally reference documentation is logically organized using folders and tags, and provides informative and useful summaries and descriptions for every individual path. Every API should have up to date and informative reference documentation that allows API consumers to understand the entire scope of an API, but also find exactly the path or paths they need to use as part of their application or integration. Reference documentation for all APIs is an essential part of a healthy API lifecycle, but teams should also be considering what other forms of documentation would help new users, specific domains, as well as describing some of the most common workflows an API is used for when it comes to desired business outcomes.</p>

      <h3>Test</h3>
      <p>A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API delivers the intended outcomes it was developed for in the first place, providing manual as well as automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly and is as performant as required, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs. API testing should not be an afterthought and should be a default aspect of the API lifecycle for any API being put into production. API testing takes a solid investment in establishing proper testing practices across teams, but once you do the work to establish a baseline of testing, properly train teams on the process and tooling involved, the investment will pay off down the road.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Contract Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Contract testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the contract that was put forth for each individual version of an API. OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections providing 100% coverage for all of the API paths present. JSON Schema provides the details of the contract, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable contract that can be manually or automatically tested against. It is common for collections to be defined for the contract tests of each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines, providing robust coverage for contract tests that developers can manually execute, or automated as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Performance testing establishes a benchmark for what can be expected when it comes to the response time for each API. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% coverage for all of the API paths present, or performance tests can be applied to just a subset of API paths. It makes sense to have performance test collections separate from other types of testing so that they can be run independently from contract, integration, or other types of tests. Helping establish that the performance levels are met from potentially different regions that reflect actual application usage of APIs. Providing a comprehensive look at the performance of an API from across multiple regions for 100%, or a sensible sampling of API paths, ensuring that APIs and the teams behind them are meeting their SLAs over time and across the entire API lifecycle.</p>

      <h3>Secure</h3>
      <p>Security must be its own area of the API lifecycle, but it is something that should span testing, authentication, and potentially other areas of the API lifecycle. Over the last five years the world of API security has expanded, while also moving further left in the API lifecycle as part of a devops shift in how APIs are delivered. There are a number of elements present when it comes to security, but depending on the overall maturity of API operations the available resources and prioritization available to adequately realize these elements vary.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Authentication</h4>
            <p><p>Authentication begins on the producer side by selecting the appropriate authentication method to use when deploying an API to the gateway, setting the tone for how identity, authentication, and access control will work across the API lifecycle. Next, authentication can be defined as part of API consumption at the collection, folder, or individual request level, providing a very configurable authentication layer for automating across API operations. Authentication works seamlessly with environments, allowing secrets and tokens to be abstracted away to environments, but then applied to collections as part of specific authentication configuration using variables. Providing a very flexible and practical approach to applying authentication across many different APIs across many different teams in a manual or automated way.</p>

            <h4>Security Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Security testing ensures that 100% of the surface area of an API is secure against the common types of attacks as defined by OWASP. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% test coverage for all API paths, ensuring that every API, and detail of the API is evaluated as part of common security practices. No API should move into production without having a security collection defined for testing for all of the known vulnerabilities, moving the security conversation further left in the API lifecycle–allowing developers to manually test as they develop an API, but then also allowing for the automation of API security testing as part of the deployment pipeline, or scheduled via a monitor. Security testing is just one part of a larger testing, but also security strategy, helping standardize how security is applied, while also properly equipping teams with the latest information and practices they need to be successful in securing API operations.</p>

      <h3>Monitor</h3>
      <p>Monitors can be used to execute any Postman collection applied to any environment. Due to the versatility of what a Postman collection can define, collections turn monitors into a powerful API automation and orchestration tool. Beginning with the ability to schedule contract, performance, and other types of tests, but then also allowing for automating specific workflows across many different APIs. Since collections can be used to define anything that can be defined via an API, monitors can be used to schedule the running of each capability from multiple cloud regions, applying many different environmental variables. Making monitors an essential, versatile, and executable part of defining how the API lifecycle works.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Contract Testing Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any contract test, taking any collection of API requests, complete with test scripts, combined with a targeted environment, and run in a variety of cloud regions on a recurring schedule. Providing the ability to independently execute the contract testing for each API, but then monitor the contract testing of each API over time to make sure nothing has changed. Providing the essential automation of contract testing needed to ensure it is consistently applied across all APIs, defining whether or not an API is not just meeting the uptime portion of its service level agreement, but actually is meeting business needs in an ongoing way.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any performance test, taking a single, or a variety of API paths and making sure they meet the established baseline for response time. Monitors take your performance testing collections and allow for their execution on a recurring schedule, from any cloud region, with a specific set of environment variables applied at execution time. It is important that performance testing exist as their own collections so that performance testing monitors can become more precise in where and when they run, providing a robust look at API performance from the regions and times of day that matter the most. Performance testing monitors are essential in realizing a certain quality of service at scale across all APIs in production, providing an executable unit for understanding the performance of all API resources and capabilities over time.</p>

            <h4>Security Testing Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any security test, taking collections that are generated from an OpenAPI and scanning every path for potential vulnerabilities. Collections provide the definition of the surface area of the API and test scripts provide the ability to automate security testing against each individual path, which is something that when combined with a specific environment, and then schedule to run as a monitor becomes a very robust way to scale security testing across the surface area all APIs.. Allowing any developer to add security testing to the stack of contract, performance, and other testing, but then also contributing to the overall security strategy applied across API operations, meeting the needs of individual APIs, but automating security in a way that prevents any API from falling behind, and becoming the next breach we’ll read about in the news.</p>

      <h3>Discover</h3>
      <p>The ability to discover APIs at all stages of the API lifecycle is essential for reducing redundancy across operations, helping teams find existing APIs before they develop new ones, properly matching API consumers with the right APIs, while supporting documentation, relevant workflows, and the feedback loops that exist as part of the operation of APIs internally within the enterprise, or externally with 3rd party developers. API discovery does not live at the beginning or the end of the API lifecycle, but should be considered across all areas of the API lifecycle, ensuring that APIs, as well as the operations around them are as discoverable as possible, but well informed when it comes to privacy, security, and terms of service.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Search</h4>
            <p><p>Search is the fundamental element of API discovery, allowing API producers to search for existing APIs before they begin the development of new APIs, as well as API consumers to search for APIs they can use as part of their applications and integrations. A healthy API lifecycle depends on the ability to search internally and externally for APIs, as well as the operations around them. The indexing of workspaces, APIs, and the elements of the API lifecycle like documentation, mock servers, and tests should occur by default across all teams before the desired efficiency and velocity will be realized across operations. Postman platform search provides visibility across these dimensions of API operations, looking across private, partner, and public dimensions, but then also leverages a role based approach to what elements of API operations are surfaced based upon your role–making API search a priority as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Private Network</h4>
            <p><p>A private network is available for any team as part of the Postman platform. The private team network is accessible via the home page and provides a place to publish APIs, and each version of an API so they can be discovered by internal consumers. APIs can be added to the private network from the network itself, as well as part of managing the API within any workspace where the API is being managed. APIs in the private network will show up in the wider search, and allow for grouping and browsing by folder. Enabling teams who are producing APIs to easily increase the visibility of their APIs across teams, and beyond the workspaces where they are being developed. Increasing the chance that other teams will find before they begin developing a potentially duplicate API, or be able to put it to use within the application or integration they have planned.</p>

            <h4>Public Network</h4>
            <p><p>The Postman public network is where you will find APIs from leading providers like Stripe, Twilio, and Salesforce, while also being the place you can publish your own public APIs for discovery by millions of Postman users. The public network is where teams can discover other public APIs they can put to work, or help make their own public APIs more discoverable by other 3rd party consumers. APIs can be published to the public network by changing the visibility of the workspaces they are in to be public, making the APIs, collections, environments, and other elements viewable by anyone browsing or searching the Postman public API network.
