   <h1 class="h1">The Base of the API Lifecycle</h1>
   <p><p>The API lifecycle will mean many different things depending on who you are talking to. This base API lifecycle isn’t meant to be a lifecycle definition that matches the needs of every enterprise organization, but is intended to provide you with a base example to help you begin thinking about what your own API lifecycle is. The blueprint is designed to provide you a base that you can add to or remove from, iterating upon until you find a common definition of the API lifecycle that works for your organization.</p>

      <h3>Define</h3>
      <p>Making sure the operations around an API are properly defined, laying the foundation for being able to effectively design and bring an API to life, while also establishing a known place, or places to go to get all the information you need regarding each individual API or groups of APIs.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Team Members</h4>
            <p><p>Once a team or public workspace has been established for an API, or group of APIs, it is time to define and invite all relevant team members to the workspace. Sitting down to make sure your team is well defined and invited to your workspace and repositories allows you to think through who is involved, what roles they have in moving an API forward, and is something you can revisit on a regular basis. It is also something that allows others to easily see who is involved with an API, and who they can reach out to with questions or feedback through the life of an API.</p>

            <h4>Team Workspace</h4>
            <p><p>Any API you are looking to develop should have a known location where any stakeholder can get up to speed on what is happening with the development and operation of an API. Postman team workspaces provide a single location to publish APIs, documentation, mock servers, tests, and other artifacts, providing a known location that is discoverable across teams. Establishing early on a place for teams to engage around the design, development, and operation of an API, that makes the API lifecycle observable by default. Team workspaces are only accessible internally to your team members who have an account under your designated organizational Postman team, making it available across search, and via workspace browsing for your team to discover and begin collaborating and working across APIs being developed within each workspace.</p>

            <h4>Public Workspace</h4>
            <p><p>Public API workspaces provides teams with the ability to change the visibility on their personal, private, and team workspace making them available to the general public, making APIs, collections, mock servers, and other elements of API operations accessible to any 3rd part consumer. Public workspaces are an evolution of the classic concept of a developer portal, but widening the scope to include more of the operations around each API instead of just the API itself. Opening up access around aPIs to 3rd party consumers, but also allowing them to engage by watching, commenting, and forking APIs as part of integrating and putting APIs to work in applications and other systems.</p>

      <p>Establishing a formal process and approach to designing an API helps establish consistency of each API that ends up in production, ensuring that APIs are developed using common industry and organizational patterns while establishing known practices for shaping the surface area and behaviors of APIs.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>OpenAPI</h4>
            <p><p>The OpenAPI acts as the contract for any HTTP API, providing a machine readable way to describe the details of each request and response in a way that can be used across the entire API lifecycle. OpenAPI can be introduced in different ways via the API lifecycle, but once introduced should be managed as the source of truth for each API, always keeping up to date and managed via Postman workspace as well as synced to relevant repositories. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections for documentation, mocking, testing, and other areas of the API lifecycle, providing executable representations of each API tailored for a specific purpose, while maintaining a single source of truth for the contract of each API that can be used to keep docs, mocks, and tests in sync, but also to validate that each API contract is being met.</p>

            <h4>Mock Server</h4>
            <p><p>Mock servers provide a simulated reflection of what each API can do, mocking each path request, as well as the response. It is difficult to mock every feature of an API, but mock servers will get you about 75% of the way towards what you will experience in production. An easy to use mock server will help your team get hands on with what an API does, while also allowing them to quickly iterate upon the design and provide feedback without actually having to write code. Mock servers can be defined by generating Postman collections from OpenAPI definitions, and it even can make sense to have multiple mock servers tailored for specific business use cases or outcomes, providing usable representations of the value that an API will deliver in production. Mock servers can be made publicly available or restricted by API key, helping reduce friction for usage, while also potentially limiting who has access to mocked instances of an API.</p>

            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p><p>Comments can be applied to APIs and collections, providing a feedback loop for each individual API artifact, as well as inline comments for each part of an API artifact. Comments can be used to keep the feedback loop localized with each API, as well as allowing team members and the public to be more precise by highlighting and commenting on a specific path, parameter, or part of a script automating or testing an API. Comments are a little buried beneath the details of each API and collection, but once your team realizes they are there and they can comment, mention, and have a conversation about each part of producing or consuming APIs, they’ll prefer commenting here rather than via other external channels, helping any other team members or public consumers join in and learn from the discussion.</p>

      <p>Having complete, accurate, and easy to follow documentation is essential for all APIs, alleviating the number one pain point for API consumers when it comes to onboarding with APIs, providing the human-readable technical details of what an API does, helping minimize the time to first API call.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Reference Documentation</h4>
            <p><p>The most common form of API documentation is what can be described as reference documentation, providing a complete “menu” of all paths available for an API, along with all the parameters, headers, body, and examples to put to use. Ideally reference documentation is logically organized using folders and tags, and provides informative and useful summaries and descriptions for every individual path. Every API should have up to date and informative reference documentation that allows API consumers to understand the entire scope of an API, but also find exactly the path or paths they need to use as part of their application or integration. Reference documentation for all APIs is an essential part of a healthy API lifecycle, but teams should also be considering what other forms of documentation would help new users, specific domains, as well as describing some of the most common workflows an API is used for when it comes to desired business outcomes.</p>

            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p><p>Examples are essential to API operations for helping demonstrate what an API does and how it can be used. Examples can accompany API documentation to make onboarding with an API much more intuitive, and examples could be used to mock an API during the design or testing parts of the API lifecycle. Examples can help API designers and developers think through what an API should do as part of the API design or prototyping process, and can be used to provide a sandbox environment for API consumers to learn about how APIs work without working with production data. Beyond these areas of the API lifecycle, the process of producing rich examples for each individual API request or response, and multiple examples for different use cases helps better inform API designers and developers as part of the journey, resulting in a much richer API developer experience in the end.</p>

            <h4>CI/CD Pipeline</h4>
            <p><p>CI/CD pipelines are an essential part of automating the delivery of APIs, and there are multiple ways they can be used in conjunction with the Postman platform from deployment, to testing and governance. Postman collections are executable units that can be run individually and sequentially as part of a CI/CD pipeline, publishing documentation, running contract, integration, and performance tests, or leverage infrastructure APIs behind our APIs to automate any part of the API lifecycle. Jenkins, Github Actions, and other CI/CD solutions allow for the execution of manually created or dynamically generated Postman collections, providing an excellent mechanism for standardizing how API lifecycle automation occurs across many different APIs, while also utilizing a standardized approach to moving APIs forward as part of an agreed upon API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Gateway</h4>
            <p><p>Gateways are an essential part of a modern API lifecycle, providing a standardized way for providing access to APIs. Gateways are available as commercial or open source offerings, and are a default part of cloud infrastructure, having been commoditized around 2015, and since become critical to the enterprise API lifecycle. Gateways use OpenAPI and other artifacts to define routes, and often use extensions to route requests to backend systems, while applying consistent policies across APIs to define identity and access control, transformations, logging, and other common needs involved in managing APIs. In addition to API deployment, API gateways are how API producers are able to stay aware of how API consumers are putting APIs to work, establishing awareness of how API resources are being applied–offering another direction for API gateway usage within Postman by pulling identity, access, and usage data back into the platform, and making it part of how teams stay informed across the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Usage Plan</h4>
            <p><p>Every API should operate within one or many well-defined usage plans. No API consumer, whether internal or external to an organization, should have access to an API outside of the definition of a usage plan that is governed at the API management layer. Usage plans are a standard part of API gateways and management solutions, and provide mechanisms for defining rate limiting and other access policies in a standardized way. Usage plans govern how APIs can be used across internal and external consumers, ensuring that no API has unlimited access or usage, requiring all consumers to be identified by a key, and providing observability into API usage by individual consumers, or across an entire plan. Usage plans are central to the management of public and private APIs, and are how the value exchange between API producers and consumers is maximized, ensuring all API usage is in alignment with business objectives.</p>

      <h3>Test</h3>
      <p>A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API delivers the intended outcomes it was developed for in the first place, providing manual as well as automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly and is as performant as required, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Contract Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Contract testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the contract that was put forth for each individual version of an API. OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections providing 100% coverage for all of the API paths present. JSON Schema provides the details of the contract, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable contract that can be manually or automatically tested against. It is common for collections to be defined for the contract tests of each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines, providing robust coverage for contract tests that developers can manually execute, or automated as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Performance testing establishes a benchmark for what can be expected when it comes to the response time for each API. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% coverage for all of the API paths present, or performance tests can be applied to just a subset of API paths. It makes sense to have performance test collections separate from other types of testing so that they can be run independently from contract, integration, or other types of tests. Helping establish that the performance levels are met from potentially different regions that reflect actual application usage of APIs. Providing a comprehensive look at the performance of an API from across multiple regions for 100%, or a sensible sampling of API paths, ensuring that APIs and the teams behind them are meeting their SLAs over time and across the entire API lifecycle.</p>

      <h3>Secure</h3>
      <p>Ensuring that there is a consistent approach to identity and access management for each API, but also the proper security testing in place to make sure that all APIs are being secured in a consistent way no matter which team developed them, or whether they will be used for private, partner, or public use in applications.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Authentication</h4>
            <p><p>Authentication begins on the producer side by selecting the appropriate authentication method when deploying an API to the gateway, setting the tone for how identity, authentication, and access control will work across the API lifecycle. Next, authentication can be defined as part of API consumption at the collection, folder, or individual request level, providing a configurable authentication layer for automating across API operations. Authentication should be balanced across both the producer and consumer side of the API lifecycle, putting well-known practices to work, allowing both sides to securely access, refresh, and engage with necessary authentication.</p>

            <h4>Security Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Security testing ensures that 100% of the surface area of an API is secure against the common types of attacks as defined by OWASP. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% test coverage for all API paths, ensuring that every API, and detail of the API is evaluated as part of common security practices. No API should move into production without having a security collection defined for testing for all of the known vulnerabilities, moving the security conversation further left in the API lifecycle–allowing developers to manually test as they develop an API, but then also allowing for the automation of API security testing as part of the deployment pipeline, or scheduled via a monitor. Security testing is just one part of a larger testing, but also security strategy, helping standardize how security is applied, while also properly equipping teams with the latest information and practices they need to be successful in securing API operations.</p>

      <h3>Monitor</h3>
      <p>Making sure that all APIs are fully monitored by scheduling contract, performance, security, and other tests from multiple cloud regions, but also being able to monitor the activity, changelog, and state of an API using notifications, helping keep teams and consumers informed regarding the state of the APIs they depend on.</p>

            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any contract test, taking any collection of API requests, complete with test scripts, combined with a targeted environment, and run in a variety of cloud regions on a recurring schedule. Providing the ability to independently execute the contract testing for each API, but then monitor the contract testing of each API over time to make sure nothing has changed. Providing the essential automation of contract testing needed to ensure it is consistently applied across all APIs, defining whether or not an API is not just meeting the uptime portion of its service level agreement, but actually is meeting business needs in an ongoing way.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any performance test, taking a single, or a variety of API paths and making sure they meet the established baseline for response time. Monitors take your performance testing collections and allow for their execution on a recurring schedule, from any cloud region, with a specific set of environment variables applied at execution time. It is important that performance testing exist as their own collections so that performance testing monitors can become more precise in where and when they run, providing a robust look at API performance from the regions and times of day that matter the most. Performance testing monitors are essential in realizing a certain quality of service at scale across all APIs in production, providing an executable unit for understanding the performance of all API resources and capabilities over time.</p>

            <h4>Security Testing Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any security test, taking collections that are generated from an OpenAPI and scanning every path for potential vulnerabilities. Collections provide the definition of the surface area of the API and test scripts provide the ability to automate security testing against each individual path, which is something that when combined with a specific environment, and then schedule to run as a monitor becomes a very robust way to scale security testing across the surface area all APIs.. Allowing any developer to add security testing to the stack of contract, performance, and other testing, but then also contributing to the overall security strategy applied across API operations, meeting the needs of individual APIs, but automating security in a way that prevents any API from falling behind, and becoming the next breach we’ll read about in the news.</p>

            <h4>Activity</h4>
            <p><p>Tracking the activity that occurs across the design, development, and operation of APIs allows the ability to see what changes are made by teams to APIs and the supporting artifacts. Ensuring that there is observability present across the management of each API without teams having to do any additional work, tracking all changes, and then make this information visible to everyone involved. Providing an ongoing snapshot of the activity involved with moving each API forward, making sure nothing gets lost along the way. You can find an activity for each workspace using the overview tab and across workspaces via the home page of your Postman application.</p>

            <h4>Change Log</h4>
            <p><p>The change log for an API should inform stakeholders regarding what has happened with the design and development of an API, providing a single place that any team member or consumers can go to get up to speed on what has changed. Providing a self-service log of the change that has occurred, reducing the need to talk to designers and developers, helping increase velocity of team members, while also making sure there is a thorough record available for each API to keep all stakeholders informed regarding the change that is occurring across a platform.</p>

            <h4>Notifications</h4>
            <p><p>Notifications are designed to keep developers informed across the APIs that matter. Providing in-application, email, and other types of integration-enabled notifications via existing channels. Notifications help make API operations and the API lifecycle real time and event-driven, helping keep developers up to speed on what is happening without having to go find the information themselves. Notifications provide the heartbeat of what teams are up and what they are doing when it comes to producing and consuming APIs. Notifications represents the next generation of communication around API operations, replacing email, chat, and other existing forms of communicating, making notifications more precise and applicable to what developers are worried about.</p>

            <h4>Search</h4>
            <p><p>Search is the fundamental element of API discovery, allowing API producers to search for existing APIs before they begin the development of new APIs, as well as API consumers to search for APIs they can use as part of their applications and integrations. A healthy API lifecycle depends on the ability to search internally and externally for APIs, as well as the operations around them. The indexing of workspaces, APIs, and the elements of the API lifecycle like documentation, mock servers, and tests should occur by default across all teams before the desired efficiency and velocity will be realized across operations. Postman platform search provides visibility across these dimensions of API operations, looking across private, partner, and public dimensions, but then also leverages a role based approach to what elements of API operations are surfaced based upon your role–making API search a priority as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Private Network</h4>
            <p><p>A private network is available for any team as part of the Postman platform. The private team network is accessible via the home page and provides a place to publish APIs, and each version of an API so they can be discovered by internal consumers. APIs can be added to the private network from the network itself, as well as part of managing the API within any workspace where the API is being managed. APIs in the private network will show up in the wider search, and allow for grouping and browsing by folder. Enabling teams who are producing APIs to easily increase the visibility of their APIs across teams, and beyond the workspaces where they are being developed. Increasing the chance that other teams will find before they begin developing a potentially duplicate API, or be able to put it to use within the application or integration they have planned.</p>

            <h4>Public Network</h4>
            <p><p>The Postman public network is where you will find APIs from leading providers like Stripe, Twilio, and Salesforce, while also being the place you can publish your own public APIs for discovery by millions of Postman users. The public network is where teams can discover other public APIs they can put to work, or help make their own public APIs more discoverable by other 3rd party consumers. APIs can be published to the public network by changing the visibility of the workspaces they are in to be public, making the APIs, collections, environments, and other elements viewable by anyone browsing or searching the Postman public API network. The public network isn’t just about API discovery, it is also about helping bring observability and engagement with public API consumers more discoverable and accessible. Moving from the many siloed API portals of the past, where API producers work to build their own API ecosystems, to where API producers just participate as part of a larger API platform ecosystem–where developers already exist.</p>
