   <h1 class="h1">Test Automation</h1>
   <p><p>This blueprint focuses just on the test automation portion of the API lifecycle, highlighting the different types of tests that can be run, how monitors can be used to automate those tests on a schedule from multiple regions, and then how to tap into the observability opportunities that exist when it comes to test automation. Test automation should provide you with a 50K foot view of how testing works in conjunction with monitors, and what observability is available by default, published using visualizer, or introduced through integrations with external solutions, providing many different ways of being able to see and understand test automation for API operations.</p>

      <h3>Test</h3>
      <p>A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API accomplishes the intended purpose it was developed for, providing manual and automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly, is as performant as required, and meets the security expectations of everyone involved, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Contract Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Contract testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the contract that was put forth for each individual version of an API. OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections providing 100% coverage for all of the API paths present. JSON Schema provides the details of the contract, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable contract that can be manually or automatically tested against. It is common for collections to be defined for the contract tests of each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines, providing robust coverage for contract tests that developers can manually execute, or automated as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Performance Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Performance testing establishes a benchmark for what can be expected when it comes to the response time for each API. The OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections that provide 100% coverage for all of the API paths present, or performance tests can be applied to just a subset of API paths. It makes sense to have performance test collections separate from other types of testing so that they can be run independently from contract, integration, or other types of tests. Helping establish that the performance levels are met from potentially different regions that reflect actual application usage of APIs. Providing a comprehensive look at the performance of an API from across multiple regions for 100%, or a sensible sampling of API paths, ensuring that APIs and the teams behind them are meeting their SLAs over time and across the entire API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Integration Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Integration testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the integration that was put for with each version. Potentially using the OpenAPI for an API to generate tests, or generate collections that can be used to define specific business objectives or business scenarios. JSON Schema provides the details of the integration, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable integration that can be manually or automatically tested against, ensuring that each API doesn’t change over time. It is common for collections to be define for the integration tests for each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines. Providing robust coverage for integration tests that developers can manually run, or automate as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

            <p><p>Postman monitors allow you to schedule the run of any collection, automating the run of API testing, governance, workflows, and anything else that is API-driven and can be defined as a collection. Monitors allow for the automation and orchestration of an almost infinite number of API capabilities, allowing for automating working with APIs, but also the API lifecycle. Monitors are how the API lifecycle becomes the moving API factory floor of an organization across different teams. API monitors run collections combined with different environments then allow the results to be published and piped into existing APM and other solutions, helping make API operations more observable.</p>

Providing the essential automation of contract testing needed to ensure it is consistently applied across all APIs, defining whether or not an API is not just meeting the uptime portion of its service level agreement, but actually is meeting business needs in an ongoing way.</p>

            <h4>Contract Testing Monitor Results</h4>
            <p><p>When each collection is executed by a monitor it has a set of results that can be published to any location and saved for reporting upon and included in other dashboards.

            <h4>Performance Testing Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any performance test, taking a single, or a variety of API paths and making sure they meet the established baseline for response time. Monitors take your performance testing collections and allow for their execution on a recurring schedule, from any cloud region, with a specific set of environment variables applied at execution time. It is important that performance testing exist as their own collections so that performance testing monitors can become more precise in where and when they run, providing a robust look at API performance from the regions and times of day that matter the most. Performance testing monitors are essential in realizing a certain quality of service at scale across all APIs in production, providing an executable unit for understanding the performance of all API resources and capabilities over time.</p>

            <h4>Uptime Testing Monitor Results</h4>
            <p><p>When each collection is executed by a monitor it has a set of results that can be published to any location and saved for reporting upon and included in other dashboards. Having a strategy and standardized approach to handling the results of uptime test runs helps inform individual developers and testers how they can handle test rules, and potentially allowing compliance with overall organizational API governance. Formalizing how test results inform API operations in real time, but also potentially providing historical data on the uptime testing across teams and APIs.</p>

      </ul>
   

      <h3>Observability</h3>
      <p>Tapping into the outputs available across API operations to understand what is happening with individual APIs throughout their lifecycle, but also in aggregate for domains, teams, and other logical groups, helping make API operations more visible in real time.</p>
         
      
         
            
            <h4>Activity</h4>
            <p><p>Tracking the activity that occurs across the design, development, and operation of APIs allows the ability to see what changes are made by teams to APIs and the supporting artifacts. Ensuring that there is observability present across the management of each API without teams having to do any additional work, tracking all changes, and then make this information visible to everyone involved. Providing an ongoing snapshot of the activity involved with moving each API forward, making sure nothing gets lost along the way. You can find an activity for each workspace using the overview tab and across workspaces via the home page of your Postman application.</p>

            <h4>Reports</h4>
            <p><p>Reports provide teams with visibility into the usage of individual APIs, but also the operations around them, helping us see activity, history, and the presence, or lack of presences of essential elements of the API lifecycle like documentation, testing, and other building blocks. The Postman platform provides native reporting on teams, APIs, and the activity that exists across workspaces. While also embracing an integration strategy that allows for the piping of data into other APM and observability solutions organizations are already using, providing another dimension for the creation of reports, and making them available via existing dashboards. Using API reporting to make APIs and API operations more visible in real time, allowing teams to stay aware of what is happening and be response to events that matter to an organization.</p>

            <h4>Change Log</h4>
            <p><p>The change log for an API should inform stakeholders regarding what has happened with the design and development of an API, providing a single place that any team member or consumers can go to get up to speed on what has changed. Providing a self-service log of the change that has occurred, reducing the need to talk to designers and developers, helping increase velocity of team members, while also making sure there is a thorough record available for each API to keep all stakeholders informed regarding the change that is occurring across a platform.</p>

            <h4>Contract Testing Monitor Report</h4>
            <p><p>With the run of each contract test monitor the results can be viewed using visualizer at run time, or the results can be saved, and reported upon later. Contract testing monitor results can be viewed internally within Postman and each contract testing collection using the visualizer tab and supporting test script, keeping reporting localized to each API and it’s tests. Contract testing monitor results can also be piped into other APM solutions using integrations, allowing for reporting to occur within dashboards within existing APM solutions used by teams.</p>

            <h4>Application Performance Management (APM)</h4>
            <p><p>Postman doesn’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to application performance management and embraces the use of existing APM solutions by making them a first-class integration within the platform, allowing you to integrate with Datadog, New Relic, and other APM solutions. Platform APM integrations will enable you to pipe the results of any collection run via a monitor into existing APM infrastructure. This approach to integration allows results of collection runs for contract, integration, performance, and other types of tests to be piped into APM solutions, providing visibility over the execution of any collection.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>This blueprint is meant to provide a standardized approach to automating the testing of APIs across operations as part of a standardized API lifecycle. Each element within this blueprint works to provide a simple overview of what is involved across the entire life of an API, with more detail present on the detail page for each element (if you are viewing this on the API lifecycle project site). If you are reading this via a PDF or printed version you can visit the landing page for this blueprint to access more information and view specific actions you might possibly consider taking as part of applying each element of this proposed lifecycle within your own operations. This blueprint is a living document and will continue to evolve and be added to over time based upon feedback from readers. If you have any questions, feedback, or feel like there is more information you need, feel free to jump on the Github discussion for this blueprint, or any of the individual elements present--the value this blueprint provides is actively defined by the feedback community members like you.</p>
