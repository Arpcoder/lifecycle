   <h1 class="h1">Test Automation</h1>
   <p><p>This blueprint focuses just on the test automation portion of the API lifecycle, highlighting the different types of tests that can be run, how monitors can be used to automate those tests on a schedule from multiple regions, and then how to tap into the observability opportunities that exist when it comes to test automation. Test automation should provide you with a 50K foot view of how testing works in conjunction with monitors, and what observability is available by default, published using visualizer, or introduced through integrations with external solutions, providing many different ways of being able to see and understand test automation for API operations.</p>

      <h3>Test</h3>
      <p>A test-driven API lifecycle ensures that each API accomplishes the intended purpose it was developed for, providing manual and automated ways to ensure an API hasn't changed unexpectedly, is as performant as required, and meets the security expectations of everyone involved, helping establish a high quality of service consistently across all APIs.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Contract Testing</h4>
            <p><p>Contract testing ensures that each individual API and collection paths comply with the contract that was put forth for each individual version of an API. OpenAPI for each API can be used to generate collections providing 100% coverage for all of the API paths present. JSON Schema provides the details of the contract, and when applied as part of an OpenAPI definition, you end up with a machine readable contract that can be manually or automatically tested against. It is common for collections to be defined for the contract tests of each API, and then have these contracts tests scheduled for regular run via a monitor, as well as included as part of CI/CD pipelines, providing robust coverage for contract tests that developers can manually execute, or automated as required as part of the API lifecycle.</p>

      <h3>Monitor</h3>
      <p>All tests applied to an API should be monitored on a logical schedule and from relevant geographic regions, monitoring that APIs aren't breaking their contract, falling below their agreed upon service level agreement (SLA), or becoming a security risk, helping automate the quality of service across APIs in a way that allows teams to be as productive as possible.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Postman monitors allow you to schedule the run of any collection, automating the run of API testing, governance, workflows, and anything else that is API-driven and can be defined as a collection. Monitors allow for the automation and orchestration of an almost infinite number of API capabilities, allowing for automating working with APIs, but also the API lifecycle. Monitors are how the API lifecycle becomes the moving API factory floor of an organization across different teams. API monitors run collections combined with different environments then allow the results to be published and piped into existing APM and other solutions, helping make API operations more observable.</p>

            <h4>Contract Testing Monitor</h4>
            <p><p>Monitors can be used to automate the scheduling of any contract test, taking any collection of API requests, complete with test scripts, combined with a targeted environment, and run in a variety of cloud regions on a recurring schedule. Providing the ability to independently execute the contract testing for each API, but then monitor the contract testing of each API over time to make sure nothing has changed. Providing the essential automation of contract testing needed to ensure it is consistently applied across all APIs, defining whether or not an API is not just meeting the uptime portion of its service level agreement, but actually is meeting business needs in an ongoing way.</p>

            <h4>Contract Testing Monitor Results</h4>
            <p><p>When each collection is executed by a monitor it has a set of results that can be published to any location and saved for reporting upon and included in other dashboards. Having a strategy and standardized approach to handling the results of contract test runs helps inform individual developers and testers how they can handle test rules, and potentially allowing compliance with overall organizational API governance. Formalizing how test results inform API operations in real time, but also potentially providing historical data on the contract testing across teams and APIs.</p>

      <h3>Deploy</h3>
      <p>Tests can be automated using a CI/CD pipeline, allowing for test to be executed every time a commit or pull request is made against a repo. Allowing tests to be run against any instance of an API, ensuring that any API being deployed has not broken it's contract, and the API does what is expected.</p>
         
      
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
               
         
            
            <h4>CI/CD Pipeline</h4>
            <p><p>CI/CD pipelines are an essential part of automating the delivery of APIs, and there are multiple ways they can be used in conjunction with the Postman platform from deployment, to testing and governance. Postman collections are executable units that can be run individually and sequentially as part of a CI/CD pipeline, publishing documentation, running contract, integration, and performance tests, or leverage infrastructure APIs behind our APIs to automate any part of the API lifecycle. Jenkins, Github Actions, and other CI/CD solutions allow for the execution of manually created or dynamically generated Postman collections, providing an excellent mechanism for standardizing how API lifecycle automation occurs across many different APIs, while also utilizing a standardized approach to moving APIs forward as part of an agreed upon API lifecycle.</p>

            <h4>Newman</h4>
            <p><p>Newman is a command-line Collection Runner for Postman. It enables you to run and test a Postman Collection directly from the command line. It is built with extensibility in mind so that you can easily integrate it with your continuous integration servers and build systems. Newman maintains feature parity with Postman and allows you to run collections the way they are executed inside the collection runner in Postman. The open source Newman combined with the open source collection and environment provides a portable, executable unit of value that can be applied anywhere across API operations at the command line or pipeline layers. Providing for a robust way to apply API testing manually or in an automated way as part of the regular software development lifecycle, baking testing and governance into operations.</p>

            <p><p>With the run of each contract test monitor the results can be viewed using visualizer at run time, or the results can be saved, and reported upon later. Contract testing monitor results can be viewed internally within Postman and each contract testing collection using the visualizer tab and supporting test script, keeping reporting localized to each API and it’s tests. Contract testing monitor results can also be piped into other APM solutions using integrations, allowing for reporting to occur within dashboards within existing APM solutions used by teams.</p>

   <h2>Conclusion</h2>
   <p>This blueprint is meant to provide a standardized approach to automating the testing of APIs across operations as part of a standardized API lifecycle. Each element within this blueprint works to provide a simple overview of what is involved across the entire life of an API, with more detail present on the detail page for each element (if you are viewing this on the API lifecycle project site). If you are reading this via a PDF or printed version you can visit the landing page for this blueprint to access more information and view specific actions you might possibly consider taking as part of applying each element of this proposed lifecycle within your own operations. This blueprint is a living document and will continue to evolve and be added to over time based upon feedback from readers. If you have any questions, feedback, or feel like there is more information you need, feel free to jump on the Github discussion for this blueprint, or any of the individual elements present--the value this blueprint provides is actively defined by the feedback community members like you.</p>
