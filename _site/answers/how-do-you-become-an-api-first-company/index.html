            <p>To become an API-first company you need to establish an API platform, layer on an well-known API lifecycle, establish standardized processes for designing, documenting, testing, and monitoring APIs across teams, and invest in a platform-led approach to realizing API governance across the enterprise.</p>

         <p>Becoming API-first begins with planning and taking small incremental steps to define, standardize, and perpetually optimize how you deliver and operate your applications and integrations using APIs. Establishing a strategy for how you quantify, but also move forward APIs consistently and reliably across the enterprise, redefining your teams and operations by making a commitment to rebuilding your enterprise operations in an API-first world with the following steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Establishing a strategy for how you deliver and manage APIs across teams using a well-known API lifecycle.</li>
  <li>Always plan APIs as part of a wider API strategy before you develop any web, mobile, or device applications.</li>
  <li>Mapping all of the APIs that exist using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Collections across operations.</li>
  <li>Invest in API infrastructure to make APIs available externally to an organization to partners and the public.</li>
  <li>Provide contract and performance tests for all API that are used in CI/CD pipelines and scheduled via monitors.</li>
  <li>Require there are always common security tests in place for all APIs enforced via CI/CD pipelines and monitors.</li>
  <li>Organize the development of all APIs using well-defined workspaces and repositories containing common artifacts.</li>
  <li>Providing teams with a well-known API lifecycle that they can confidently follow and put to work via workspaces.</li>
  <li>Setting up scheduled monitors across all of your APIs, then making sure they are always piped into your APM solution.</li>
  <li>Automate the governance of design documentation, testing, and monitoring consistently across all teams and APIs.</li>
  <li>Provide a design guideline for teams, and make sure to provide examples of how to apply common standards to APIs.</li>
  <li>Ensure there is discovery and observability across 100% of the APIs used to power applications and integrations.</li>
  <li>Investing in the optimization of your operations so that you can confidently allocate innovation time across teams.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should be able to begin working in almost all of these areas as part of your regular operations through the prioritization, development, and iteration of a formal API platform and lifecycle strategy. Increasing investment in the enablement of teams who are designing, developing, and managing your APIs today. Understanding that API-first will help you optimize and improve how your teams are working today, allowing them to take the first steps towards moving your operations into an API-first world where you will be able to meet the future needs of your business.</p>
