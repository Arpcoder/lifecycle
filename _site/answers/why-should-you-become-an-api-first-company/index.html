         <p>Being API-first has the potential to dramatically increase the productivity of your teams, consistently realize high levels of quality across all of the APIs you produce, and build your operations on a solid API platform. Allowing you to establish the understanding and control you need across your operations to more effectively move the enterprise forward because:</p>

<ul>

  <li>There is always reuse and optimization of APIs across many different applications.</li>
  <li>You know where all of your digital resources and capabilities are across your teams.</li>
  <li>There is a proven process for making APIs available externally to partners and the public.</li>
  <li>There are a few errors and support tickets from team members and consumers across APIs.</li>
  <li>There are fewer vulnerabilities and security breaches present across your operations.</li>
  <li>Teams are able to accomplish more as part of their regular work in collaborative workspaces.</li>
  <li>Teams are able to deliver newer high-quality products and features in a much shorter time.</li>
  <li>Dashboards exist to understand the health and activity across all APIs that are in production.</li>
  <li>You are able to consistently move APIs forward at scale, no matter which team is behind.</li>
  <li>APIs are always consistent with organizational and industry standards that are already in use.</li>
  <li>Because regulation will become less of a challenge, and much easier to respond to.</li>
  <li>There is more time for teams to innovate in the development of products and processes.</li>
</ul>
