name: How do you become an API-first company?
description:  To become an API-first company you need to establish an API platform, layer on an well-known API lifecycle, establish standardized processes for designing, documenting, testing, and monitoring APIs across teams, and invest in a platform-led approach to realizing API governance across the enterprise.
...
Becoming API-first begins with planning and taking small incremental steps to define, standardize, and perpetually optimize how you deliver and operate your applications and integrations using APIs. Establishing a strategy for how you quantify, but also move forward APIs consistently and reliably across the enterprise, redefining your teams and operations by making a commitment to rebuilding your enterprise operations in an API-first world with the following steps:

- Establishing a strategy for how you deliver and manage APIs across teams using a well-known API lifecycle.
- Always plan APIs as part of a wider API strategy before you develop any web, mobile, or device applications.
- Mapping all of the APIs that exist using OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, JSON Schema, and Collections across operations.
- Invest in API infrastructure to make APIs available externally to an organization to partners and the public.
- Provide contract and performance tests for all API that are used in CI/CD pipelines and scheduled via monitors.
- Require there are always common security tests in place for all APIs enforced via CI/CD pipelines and monitors.
- Organize the development of all APIs using well-defined workspaces and repositories containing common artifacts.
- Providing teams with a well-known API lifecycle that they can confidently follow and put to work via workspaces.
- Setting up scheduled monitors across all of your APIs, then making sure they are always piped into your APM solution.
- Automate the governance of design documentation, testing, and monitoring consistently across all teams and APIs.
- Provide a design guideline for teams, and make sure to provide examples of how to apply common standards to APIs.
- Ensure there is discovery and observability across 100% of the APIs used to power applications and integrations.
- Investing in the optimization of your operations so that you can confidently allocate innovation time across teams.

You should be able to begin working in almost all of these areas as part of your regular operations through the prioritization, development, and iteration of a formal API platform and lifecycle strategy. Increasing investment in the enablement of teams who are designing, developing, and managing your APIs today. Understanding that API-first will help you optimize and improve how your teams are working today, allowing them to take the first steps towards moving your operations into an API-first world where you will be able to meet the future needs of your business.
