There are additional steps you can take to market your workspace and increase your likelihood of getting featured by Postman. These are things you can do to market your workspace:

- Host your own livestreams or webinars showing users how to use your APIs in Postman, like DocuSign
- Contribute an article on Postman’s blog to tell your story, like Vonage and Symbl
- Share cool stuff you’re building with the Postman community on the forum showcase
- Tag Postman on LinkedIn or Twitter in your social media messages, and we will do our best to amplify your story

Postman also promotes compelling and noteworthy workspaces. These are some of the things Postman does to feature workspaces:

- Feature teams who are creating cool stuff in the Postman API Network and In the Spotlight
- Share data-driven lists, like Trending Workspaces, Collections, and APIs
- Curate lists, like 10 API Workspaces Loved by Postman Staff and Startups to Watch
- Stream with partners like this collaborative build with Microsoft
- Stream without our partners knowing about it like this blindfold challenge with Shutterstock
