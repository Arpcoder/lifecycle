Like other stops along the API lifecycle, Postman is an API Swiss Army Knife, allowing for many different ways of executing similar tasks. When it comes to authoring an OpenAPI we work to provide you with native workflows for authoring directly within Postman API builder, but also outside of the platform, while still ensuring that each OpenAPI is available for use across the API lifecycle--here are some of the most common actions we see taken as part of OpenAPI authoring workflows:

- [Create New in Postman API Builder](https://apis.how/actions/create-a-new-openapi/)
- [Import New in Postman Using API Builder](https://apis.how/actions/import-openapi/)
- [Author in Postman API Builder](https://apis.how/actions/author-an-openapi-in-api-builder/)
- [Author in Open Source Solution](https://apis.how/actions/author-an-openapi-in-open-source-editor/)
- [Sync OpenAPI from Github](https://apis.how/actions/sync-openapi-to-github/)
- Sync OpenAPI from Postman API
